"Because I was taking her riding at this place, and every time I was taking her there, it became paparazzi central. I was like, 'I can't live like this. I want to be enjoying with my daughter,’” Gisele explained to the publication.</p><p>"This should be a fun thing that we get to do together. So I was like, this way, I can have her practice what she loves..." she went on.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Peek Inside Gisele Bündchen's Multi-Million-Dollar Car Collection</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Gisele admitted that there may be more expenses in her future thank to her daughter, who’s apparently pushing to get a second horse now that they have the property for it.</p><p>"He takes care of Vivi and I like that because he's a very easy horse," the supermodel revealed. "But she's already like, 'Mom, I have to have a new horse to jump higher.' I'm like, 'Calm down.' 'I'll work, Mom. I'll work and I'll help you.'”</p><p>"She's like, 'I need to jump higher.' I'm like, 'You're 10, calm down. Your horse jumps like a meter, 20. You're going to be fine. I think it's fine where you're jumping right now,'” she went on. Gisele shares her daughter Vivian, 10, with her ex-husband Tom Brady. They also have an older son, Ben, 13.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gisele didn’t confirm how much she paid for the farm, or where the location is exactly. But earlier this month, it was <a href=#>reported the model dropped $9 million on a Florida property</a> featuring an equestrian ring, which is likely the residence she was referring to in the PEOPLE portfolio.</p><p>The 9-bedroom residence located in Southwest Ranches, an affluent community positioned roughly 30 miles northwest of Miami.</p><p>The estate includes a state-of-the-art equestrian arena featuring 10 generously sized horse stalls. Nestled on a sprawling 7.5-acre parcel, the property also boasts an outdoor culinary paradise complete with a hibachi grill, pizza oven, BBQ pit, and a wine refrigerator.</p><p>This isn't the sole property Gisele owns in the vicinity. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She also possesses an $11.5 million mansion in Miami</a>, positioned directly across from the site where her ex-husband is constructing his new home. She acquired this property towards the end of the previous year, reportedly in the hope that its close proximity to her ex's residence would facilitate co-parenting their children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoKGjmrmmecGupZ2bmJq7bq7UsqpmnpGnum65yKWjoqeeqHqlrdSgn62domK%2FqrDEZp%2BoqqOaerG%2ByK%2BYnLFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./funny-pick-up-lines-to-make-them-smile-and-remember-you.html><span>←</span><span>Funny Pick Up Lines to Make Them Smile and Remember You</span></a>
