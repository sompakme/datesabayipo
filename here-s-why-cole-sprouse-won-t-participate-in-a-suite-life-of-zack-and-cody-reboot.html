Following its third and final series in 2011, the Sprouse brothers moved on and started working on other projects away from Disney, before Cole decided to attend New York University’s Gallatin School of Individualised Study with a four-year degree in video game design.</p><p>In recent years, the two actors have found themselves being busier than ever before, having both landed recurring roles in popular television shows, but in the midst of a lot of network and Hollywood studios working on reboots these days, it looks as if Cole and Dylan want to parts of it if Disney were to ask.</p><h2 id=the-sprouses-aren-t-interested-in-a-suite-life-reboot>The Sprouses Aren’t Interested In A ‘Suite Life’ Reboot</h2><p>During an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show in January 2021, Cole was very vocal in saying that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he doesn’t see himself or his brother signing on to star in a Disney reboot</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The conversation came up when Barrymore questioned what the 28-year-old on what he felt about the news of Sex and the City returning on HBO Max, to which he said, “Reboots are a tricky thing, you know?”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus Once Shared Why She Never Got Along With Her ‘Hannah Montana’ Co-Star Emily Osment</a></span></p><p>“The original shows when they become successful sit in this little golden plate of nostalgia and when you modernize it and go back to it, it has the potential to really disenfranchise the original fanbase so it’s a very, very touchy thing.”</p><p>He then went on to mention how fans are often asking him whether he would consider the idea of going back to Disney, but his answer has always been the same.</p><p>“I am asked all the time if Dylan and I are going to do a Suite Life reboot and I go, ‘No, absolutely not.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it’s unclear whether Disney has ever approached the siblings for roles in a potential reboot, one shouldn’t forget that The Suite Life of Zack and Cody was at one point one of the highest-rated shows on the network, reaching similar numbers in viewership as Hannah Montana and That’s So Raven.</p><p>Cole and Dylan’s show didn’t just turn them into huge child stars, it also propelled the careers of Brenda Song and Ashley Tisdale, who went on to land the role of Sharpay Evans in 2006’s High School Musical.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kourtney Kardashian Snubs Scott Disick After Rumors She’s Dating Travis Barker</a></span></p><p>She ended up being so time-consumed with rehearsals for the second and third installments that she ultimately had to bail on Suite Life on Deck. Tisdale only ended up making a cameo in one episode.</p><p>On top of that, it’s also recently been announced that Nickelodeon star Jamie Lynn Spears is also developing a reboot to her hit show Zoey 101 with most of the original cast members expected to return for the revamped version when it returns to TV screens in the near future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was just an overwhelming amount of people asking for some 'Zoey' content,” Spears told CNN in October 2020. “With not being able to fully go into production with anything or move forward as fast as we'd like, I said we've got to give them something. So, I started thinking we can't we just maybe re-do the song? A mini reboot reunion in 3 minutes and 30 seconds.”</p><p>While lots of child stars are looking to cash in on the opportunity of working on a reboot, the Sprouses aren’t interested, and when you consider how busy these guys have been in recent years, it’s not hard to see why.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">From ‘Teenage Dream’ To ‘Roar’: Katy Perry’s Biggest Moments In Music History</a></span></p><p>Cole, in particular, has had a lot of success playing Jughead Jones in the ever-so-popular CW series Riverdale, having so far appeared in well over 70 episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also had a recurring role in the TV series Borrasca in 2020, just one year after starring in the drama-romance flick Five Feet Award.</p><p>His brother Dylan has also been keeping himself occupied, starring in the TV series dewlover420’s Vloog, the 2020 motion picture After We Collided, and he’s expected to star in the upcoming Tyger Tyger and Turandot.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Cole has built an $8 million net worth, while Dylan is rumored to have amassed a $10 million fortune.</p><p>With the way his career going at the moment, those numbers are sure to skyrocket in the coming years - especially if&nbsp;Riverdale continues being as successful as it has in the past four years, since its arrival on Netflix.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye West Fans Think He ‘Dumped’ Kim Kardashian And She’s Trying To ‘Save Face’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmmqiklWLAsb7OrqqeZaeku7V5z5qpraGTnr2iwMRmoKdlkWLAtrXTnmSloZaaerCyjLOYnKNdlrulecKom7JlopqvsLvTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./will-buster-murdaugh-inherit-anything-plight-explored-in-wake-of-alex-murdaugh-guilty-verdict.html><span>←</span><span>Will Buster Murdaugh inherit anything?
