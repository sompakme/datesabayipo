"That was never my experience. In fact, it was the most diverse place I have ever been in my 20 years of entertainment."</p><p>The backlash came swiftly.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>PREVIOUSLY:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title href=#>"We Are Completely Devastated" - Vanessa Bryant Posts First Words Since Kobe & Gianna's Death</a></strong></span></p><p>Fans were upset at the fact that Terry would attempt to rebuff Gab's assertions before NBC made the findings of their own investigation public. His statement followed Union getting taken off the judging panel for the show back in November. Variety reported Union was ousted after making claims of sexism and racially insensitive behavior, including being told on countless occasions that her hairstyles were "too black."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Crews has since apologized for his actions, admitting that he did not take time to consider anyone else's experience but his own.</p><p>“I hear you, I respect you and understand you," he wrote on Twitter. I am sorry, and I am here to support you. I spoke from my own personal point of view without first taking into consideration someone else’s experience.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Brooklyn Nine-Nine actor also applauded Gabrielle, branding her "a role model to the entire black community".</p><p>“I informed @KevinHart4real a while back, he required 2 ‘acknowledge the discomfort of other individuals’ Now, I have to do the very same thing," he added. "I wish to excuse the remarks I made. I recognize there are a great deal of Black women injured and pull down by what I stated and likewise by what I didn’t state.”</p><p>Gabrielle has not responded to Crews' apologies but several Twitter users have expressed their feelings on the matter and don't seem to believe that the 51-year-old was genuine.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wade has reacted to the posts with a hilarious tweet which you could read below:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The former Miami Heat superstar, who retired from the NBA last year after a 16-year career, has since taken up a job as a basketball analyst with TNT and is quite active on social media.</p><p>He's obviously in his wife's corner and likely doesn't believe Crews is being genuine either. To be fair, the actor did seem to be trying too hard to sound contrite but he should have probably just steered clear of dismissing Gabrielle's claims as quickly as he did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nlKzGorrEZq6anJViwbO7y6VkrZ2ip8Zur9Gerqxll5avs7XEpaOeZaWjtrC6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zaful-adorable-cropped-sweater-can-be-worn-in-two-different-ways.html><span>←</span><span>Zaful Adorable Cropped Sweater Can Be Worn in Two Different Ways</span></a>
