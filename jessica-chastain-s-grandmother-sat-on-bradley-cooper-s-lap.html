It may seem to be a hilarious moment for Cooper now, but at the time, he was shocked.&nbsp;</p><p>On the Ellen DeGeneres Show Wednesday, she recalled the time of her grandmother Marilyn Herst who met Bradley Cooper at a party. Her grandmother broke the ice by sitting in Coopers Lap.&nbsp;</p><p>Jessica said that she saw her grandmother single from 15 to 20 years. She has uploaded her picture on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Match.com</a> and sent her a date too.&nbsp;</p><p>She added that her grandmother was excited when she told her about working with Al Pacino. She was pleased with her granddaughter when she captured a picture of her grandmother with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Marilyn framed the picture and kept it near the side of her bed. Chastain said that a few years ago, there was a party where she untied her grandmother. She was at the age she didnt care what others thought of her.&nbsp;</p><p>Her grandmother met Cooper and thought that she had to do something to get Cooper’s attention, so she sat on his lap. Jessica saw Cooper’s face with horrifying gestures.&nbsp;</p><p>She said with a laugh that the two never met each other, and they were quite silent on the table, but her grandmother had different thoughts in her mind.&nbsp;</p><p>She concluded, “I saw it kinda happening in slow motion where I was like, ‘No!’ I just started going, ‘It’s my grandma! It’s my grandma!’ Then he was like, ‘Okay. Hi, Grandma…,’.”</p><p>According to WSJ. Magazine, her mother moved to Jessica’s place in April 2020. She spent the pandemic with her grandmother, and she never felt bored staying all day with her because of her friendly nature.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Is Jessica Chastain?</h2><p>Jessica Michelle Chastain is an American actress and a film producer who is famous for her roles in feminist movies.

She always credited her maternal grandmother as she says, “she believes in me.”&nbsp;</p><p>She attended the El Camino Fundamental High School in Sacramento, and she said that she faced difficulty in her academics.
