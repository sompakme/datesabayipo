That's because there were hints on social media that they were a doting duo. Fans weren't sure whether to believe the rumors, until socialite, Lori, was seen attending Future's 36th birthday party in November. This appeared to confirm the fact that Future was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">off the market</a>...again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's no secret that the Life Is Good chart-topper has had a lot of relationships in the past - he's welcomed six children over the years, with six different women, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including R&B singer, Ciara</a>. He dated Ciara between 2013 and 2015 - she gave birth to her firstborn, Future Jr., in May of 2014.</p><p>But fans are having trouble believing that Future is a changed man. Still, he's been plastering photos of Lori on his Instagram and that is quite unusual for him, since he's not the type to showcase his romances for the world to see. He's spoiled Lori rotten with designer gifts for Christmas, a birthday vacation to Jamaica, and a recent trip to a resort in Utah. There are also rumors circulating that they're expecting their first child.</p><p>But what are the facts about this pair's relationship? We have the lowdown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-attended-future-s-36th-birthday-bash><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>She Attended Future’s 36th Birthday Bash</span></h2><p class=p1>Rumors concerning their relationship first came about when Lori Harvey attended Future’s 36th birthday bash in November 2019. Reports had already been circulating, claiming that the two were secretly seeing one another. However, things weren’t clear until she showed up to her beau’s party.</p><h2 id=they-ve-been-on-plenty-of-vacations-together><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They’ve Been On Plenty Of Vacations Together</span></h2><p class=p1>Since rumors concerning their romance surfaced, Lori and Future have quite literally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">traveled the world together</a>. From Jamaica to a short vacation at a resort in Utah, this close-knit couple has made the most of their time together so far. One can only wonder where Future will take Lori next time, or where she'll take him.</p><h2 id=she-supported-future-at-a-concert-in-nigeria><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Supported Future At A Concert In Nigeria</span></h2><p class=p1>When Future was booked to perform at an event in Lagos, Nigeria at the end of 2019, Lori was right there to support her man. It should be noted that neither of them had confirmed or denied their relationship at that point in time! However, given how much time Lori was spending with the ‘Low Life’ rapper, it seemed apparent they were dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Are 20 Photos Of Impressive Homes These Rappers Live In</a></span></p><p>Future Is Friends With Her Ex-Boyfriend, Diddy</p><p class=p1>What makes things a little awkward about their romance is that Future has been a longtime friend to Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, who was romantically linked to the Lori just a few months before she moved on with her new beau. Rumor has it that Lori <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was also seeing Diddy’s son</a>, Christian Combs, at one point.</p><h2 id=steve-harvey-chose-to-stay-out-of-their-romance><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Steve Harvey Chose To Stay Out Of Their Romance</span></h2><p class=p1>In January 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">host, funny man, and businessman</a>, Steve Harvey, broke his silence on his stepdaughter’s relationship with Future, and while he didn’t say much, it was perfectly clear as to what he was implying:<b>&nbsp;</b>“I don’t know nothing about it,” he said. When asked whether he approved of Future, Steve responded: “I don’t know nothing about it.” Yikes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=future-expressed-his-love-for-lori-on-instagram><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Future Expressed His Love For Lori On Instagram</span></h2><p class=p1>Also in January 2020, Future decided to stop hiding his relationship from the world. He posted a photo of himself with Lori- they were cuddling up in a pool while on vacation in Jamaica. The ‘Mask Off’ chart-topper captioned the pic with a simple message: “Life is Good.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ups And Downs Of Nicki Minaj’s Friendship With Drake</a></span></p><h2 id=they-re-choosing-to-remain-private-with-their-relationship><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They’re Choosing To Remain Private With Their Relationship</span></h2><p class=p1>Unlike some of his past relationships, Future openly said that he wanted to take a different approach with Lori, by not sharing everything about their relationship on social media - in the process of doing so, he’s grown to appreciate a quieter lifestyle.<b></b></p><p class=p1>"It's just, you know, what to give and you know what not to put out or whatever it is.

Eagle-eyed fans were able to spot what appeared to be a baby sonogram on her shelf, leading many to think she had a bun in the oven. But judging by Lori’s recent bikini photos on Instagram, she appears to be anything but pregnant.</p><h2 id=future-helped-celebrate-her-23rd-birthday-in-jamaica><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Future Helped Celebrate Her 23rd Birthday In Jamaica</span></h2><p class=p1>When Lori Harvey celebrated her 23rd birthday in Jamaica, she certainly wasn’t going to ring in the New Year without her man by her side. That’s right - Future made sure to be present on Lori’s big day, joining the likes of Jordyn Woods and singer, Normani, for the fun-filled occasion.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ciara Might Have Found A Brand New Career</a></span></p><h2 id=lori-and-future-live-together-in-los-angeles><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lori And Future Live Together In Los Angeles</span></h2><p class=p1>They only went public with their romance in January, but apparently neither one of them felt hesitant about the idea of living together. The couple is currently residing at their multi-million dollar home in Los Angeles, but it’s unclear how much time they actually spend there. Both of them travel frequently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-ve-dispelled-many-break-up-rumors><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They’ve Dispelled Many Break-Up Rumors</span></h2><p class=p1>In December 2020, a month before the couple publicly announced they were dating, it was rumored that they had split. Unconfirmed reports alleged that the romance had fizzled out, but fans knew that wasn’t the case, as Future tagged along to help Lori celebrate her birthday just weeks later. They’re still going strong.</p><h2 id=he-showered-her-with-roses-on-valentine-s-day><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Showered Her With Roses On Valentine’s Day</span></h2><p class=p1>For Valentine’s Day, Future went above and beyond to spoil his girlfriend - he showered her with hundreds of roses at their Los Angeles home. The entire room was covered with the most stunning floral arrangement, including bouquets of roses and flower petals on the floor. He even created a pathway made out of glowing candles.</p><h2 id=he-spoiled-her-rotten-for-christmas><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Spoiled Her Rotten For Christmas</span></h2><p class=p1>People couldn’t believe how many gifts Lori Harvey received from a particular someone - and though she never disclosed that person's name, it seemed pretty obvious that they were all from her boyfriend. On her Instagram Story, Lori showed off a range of new purses from Chanel and Gucci, before showing off her Rolex and Piguet watches.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>If that wasn’t enough, she also received a two-toned Cuban link chain, which is estimated to be worth a whopping $50,000.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ciara Is Pregnant With Baby Number 3!
