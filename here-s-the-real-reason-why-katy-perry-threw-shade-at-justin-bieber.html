For example, ever since “I Kissed A Girl” turned <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry</a> </strong>into a star, she has managed to remain highly successful in an incredibly competitive industry. Another music superstar who has reigned supreme for years at this point is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Justin Bieber and Katy Perry have both been staples of the music industry for many years at this point, it is obvious that they have rubbed elbows an awful lot. With that in mind, you may assume that the two superstars would play nice just to avoid any awkwardness when they run into one another. Amazingly enough, however, Perry once took an undeniable shot at Bieber in a very public way. While that is interesting enough, the backdrop of the insult that Perry threw at Bieber is fascinating as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why These Celebs Had Beef With Justin Bieber</a></span></p><h2 id=katy-s-idol-defense>Katy’s Idol Defense</h2><p>In the music industry, there only are so many legends who are still relevant enough to spend a lot of time in the public eye. For that reason, people tend to listen when someone who will go down in music history like Lionel Richie speaks. Unfortunately for Justin Bieber, that must have made it painful when Richie called out his singing voice during a 2018 episode of American Idol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“You know, you look at it and you think, ‘OK, if you can hit every note perfectly, why isn’t everybody a superstar?’ said the “Endless Love” crooner. “The answer is because it’s called a unique quality. If you look at Willie Nelson for a second, can he hit a gospel note? Um, no! And Bieber, he doesn’t hit a high note.”</p><p>Since he wasn’t present when Lionel Richie called him out, it is a good thing that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry quickly came to Justin Bieber’s defense</a>. At first, Perry backed Bieber by stating that Justin “hits a high note” before quickly following that up by calling him “extremely talented”. Considering that Perry easily could have let Richie’s comments go by, it was awesome to see her get the back of a fellow artist whose skills she clearly respected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber Married Hailey Baldwin, But Who Were The Famous Women Before Her?</a></span></p><h2 id=an-epic-prank>An Epic Prank</h2><p>In this day and age, it often seems like virtually everyone is dying to attain fame and riches. Since there are so many people vying for the world’s attention, at times it can be incredibly difficult for anyone to truly stand out. Despite that, in 2018 the people who run a YouTube channel called Yes Theory came up with an ingenious way to outrage the masses and briefly become famous as a result.</p><p>Throughout Justin Bieber’s time in the spotlight, he has pissed a lot of people off with his at times outrageous behavior. Never mind the fact that most teens do highly questionable things, a lot of people saw all of Bieber’s missteps as a young man as evidence that he was an awful person. Given Bieber’s at times rotten reputation, a lot of people are all too happy to sit in judgment of him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In late-2018, the people behind the Yes Theory YouTube channel had someone dress up and wear a disguise to make themself look like Justin Bieber. Then the Bieber look-alike went to a public bench and ate a burrito from the side as his photo was taken from an angle that made the image look like it was taken by the paparazzi. Then the people behind the Yes Theory YouTube channel uploaded the image on social media.</p><p>Not too long after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the fake Justin Bieber burrito photo</a> hit the internet, it went viral since people were outraged that he seemingly didn’t know something basic like how to eat a burrito. Amazingly enough, the media then quickly picked up on the situation which led to a slew of talk show hosts and news personalities mocking Bieber on television. Ultimately, everyone who covered the burrito photo looked like a fool when it was revealed that was the result of a prank.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanessa Hudgens Gets Hilariously Trolled In Elaborate Cookie Prank</a></span></p><h2 id=katy-calls-justin-out>Katy Calls Justin Out</h2><p>Considering the way that Katy Perry defended Justin Bieber during an episode of American Idol, it may seem unlikely that she would take a completely unprovoked shot at him. However, the same year that episode of American Idol aired, Perry randomly called Bieber out on Twitter.</p><p>After it was revealed that the Justin Bieber burrito photo was the result of a prank, some people felt the need to claim they saw through the image all along. Amazingly enough, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry insulted Bieber</a> at the same time she claimed to be above falling for the prank. When a Twitter user posted about the burrito photo, Katy Perry commented that she knew it actually wasn’t Bieber in the photo since “the hair was too clean”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry And Harry Styles Move Past Their Feuds With Taylor Swift</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq1tMRmqZ6ZnGK%2Fpq3SqKVmr5iueqyt07JkqZ2ip8ZuwMernLBlo52upbGMmqtmoqWowaq6jJugnpqVp3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./evangeline-lilly-looks-unrecognizable-with-new-look-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Evangeline Lilly Looks Unrecognizable With New Look: Photos</span></a>
