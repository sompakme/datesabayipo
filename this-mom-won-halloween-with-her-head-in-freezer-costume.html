And I stuffed the chicken-wing bag with Walmart bags to make it look full.” The creepiest detail: “I accidentally cut my thumb and made a real blood print for fun!” Williams says. And though most of the project was homemade, the human heart came from a Halloween store.</p><p>https://twitter.com/jwilllovely/status/792131998307319809</p><p>Next, the craft payroll processor decorated the exterior with family pictures, a bloodied dish towel and a shopping list that included instructions such as “buy shovel and stain remover.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/fridge-zoom-6aacc412-d2d9-4a88-8afd-dab908f93d3f.jpg><p>When it came time for makeup, Williams turned to Jessica, who blended white makeup with gray and blue for the deceased look. “We used rock candy for the ice crystals,” Williams tells Us. “And spray-painted my hair silver.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/alicia-williams-and-jessica-zoom-16392c92-fc64-4f93-ac5a-12d95bc93f8f.jpg><p>It’s the first Halloween that Williams has ever gone gory. “Last year I was ‘double vision,’ which was two faces drawn on my face,” she says. “The year before I was a vending machine.”&nbsp;</p><span class=caption></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/fridge-head-zoom-3787a748-ff46-4041-9094-319c7638e1e3.jpg><p>Those hoping for a glimpse of Williams in her costume should ring her bell early. “I will probably answer the door in costume for a while,” she tells <i>Us</i>. “But it gets really hot in there and you can’t sit down!”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatoJmoeq67zGauqKZdna6tuM6wnJ6mXay2tbSMoZyrZZiarqV5yKdkn6qVmsemvoycpqyspaKybsOTbW5ub2Zk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-planned-different-amas-2019-performance-amid-drama.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Planned Different AMAs 2019 Performance Amid Drama</span></a>
