During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live, Paris opened up about the unusual gift.</p><p>“<a href=#>Kim and Kourtney and Kris sent me</a> this giant alpaca, not a real one,” she explained. “It’s just so cool. I have it in the front of my house now. It’s the cutest thing. I hug it every day.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner Lost Millions Of Followers & Dollars Amid Selena Gomez Feud</a></span></p><p>That wasn’t the only expensive gift Paris received after welcoming her son via surrogate in January. Her husband, Carter Reum, gifted her a luxury baby stroller. “Carter just got me this Dior stroller,” she continued. “The same one Cardi B has and it’s so sick.”</p><p>Paris opened up about her decision to use a surrogate in February, explaining it stemmed from a deep-rooted fear of childbirth as well as abuse she suffered at a Utah boarding school, Provo Canyon School, which she attended for a year at age 16.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>" <a href=#>I'm just so scared,”</a> Paris said. “I think, again, leading back to Provo of even being in a doctor's office, just all of that. The shots, the IVs that they put in."</p><p>"When I was in The Simple Life, I had to be in a room when a woman was giving birth, and that traumatized me as well," she continued. "But I want a family so bad, it's just the physical part of doing it. I'm just so scared […] childbirth and death are the two things that scare me more than anything in the world."</p><p>During the same interview with Glamour, Paris admitted that Kim was the one who introduced her to the idea of IVF and surrogacy. Kim used surrogates to welcome her two youngest children, Chicago and Psalm, with her then-husband Kanye West.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Kim told me about that as well," Paris continued. "I'm using the same doctor — Dr. Huang, who's the best — and he has a concierge team that deals with everything and interviews the people [the surrogate] to make sure that they're healthy."</p><p>Kim’s recent present to Paris was certainly elaborate, but it may not be the most expensive baby shower gift she’s given away. The reality star reportedly gave Beyonce a <a href=#>KKW Beauty contour palette in a solid gold box, worth $150,000</a>.</p><p>This may be surprising, given that <a href=#>Beyonce has long been rumored to dislike Kim</a>. Perhaps Kim would’ve had more success gifting an alpaca.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Jon Hamm Spent Nearly Half A Million On His Fiance’s Engagement Ring</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Just Jared</a>, <a href=#>Glamour</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8qipGajkaexor%2FHopinZZeWw6Z5z5qpoqtdnbatwM6nZJplppq%2FunnSramappeaeqOtwbJkrKCfrLKzecaina1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jean-michel-basquiat-king-pleasure-documentary-in-the-works.html><span>←</span><span>Jean-Michel Basquiat 'King Pleasure' Documentary In The Works</span></a>
