This discretion, while commendable, has sparked speculation and conjecture about her relationships and sexuality. While the rumors continue to circulate, Hawke's insistence on delineating her private life is refreshing in a world where public figures' personal lives are often overexposed, yet it leaves the door open for numerous assumptions.</p><h2 id=maya-hawke-39-s-roles-have-fans-wonder-if-she-39-s-gay-in-real-life><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Maya Hawke's Roles Have Fans Wonder If She's Gay In Real Life?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Maya-Hawke-in-Do-Revenge-via-Slash-Film.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Indeed, Maya Hawke's choice of roles, especially those with undefined or LGBTQ+ sexual orientations, has led to conjecture about her real-life sexuality. According to Tuko, her portrayal of Jo March in the BBC adaptation of Little Women, a character with an ambiguous sexuality in the original novel, added fuel to the rumors.</p><p>Similarly, her depiction of Robin in Stranger Things, a character openly attracted to women, prompted further queries. Beyond these roles, Hawke's character Eleanor in Do Revenge, who is in a same-sex relationship, further deepens the intrigue.</p><h2 id=has-maya-hawke-commented-on-her-sexuality><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Has Maya Hawke Commented On Her Sexuality?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpg_20230626_134446_0000.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to We Got This Covered, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maya Hawke's sexuality has been a topic of conversation</a> due to her representation of diverse characters on-screen and her decision to remain relatively silent about her personal life. However, the actress herself has not publicly identified as gay or made any statements that could provide insight into her sexuality.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Maya Hawke Almost Wasn't In Do Revenge Because Of Stranger Things</a></span></p><p>This leaves the speculation without concrete substantiation. When it comes to her dating history, it is not entirely transparent due to her privacy preference. Reports suggest her romantic involvements have been with men, which may offer some insight but does not conclusively define her sexual orientation.

Sparked by appearances at public events such as Dior Fashion Week, rumors of a romance between Maya Hawke and indie-pop musician Spencer Barnett are rife.</p><p>Despite their silence on the matter, their shared love of music, evidenced by Barnett's 2017 single "Whatever" and Hawke's 2020 album "Blush," suggests a strong bond. Allegedly introduced by <a href=#>Hawke's brother Levon Roan Thurman-Hawke</a>, their connection seems to grow deeper despite their lack of social media confirmations. Their shared public moment on Valentine's Day 2022 in Manhattan continues to fuel speculations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-maya-hawke-39-s-relationship-history><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Inside Maya Hawke's Relationship History</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpg_20230626_134703_0000.jpg><p>According to Distractify, in 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maya Hawke was linked to actor Tom Sturridge</a>, notable for his role in Sandman. Their relationship, characterized by their frequent appearances together around New York City, drew attention primarily due to their notable age difference; at the time, Hawke was 22, and Sturridge was 35.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Maya Hawke Is Turning Heads In A New Way (With Her New Music)</a></span></p><p>Before Sturridge, Hawke reportedly had a relationship with Gus Wenner, the President and COO of Rolling Stone, in 2019.
