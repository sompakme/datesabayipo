Primary Wave Music reportedly owns an undisclosed stake, though the details haven’t been publicized.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michael Jackson passed away in 2009 from cardiac arrest. Some reports say <a href=#>he had a net worth of $100 million</a> at the time of his death.</p><p>However, his estate has continued to make money through his likeness, including licensed merchandise, documentaries, and publishing rights to his music.</p><p>In the last year alone, multiple artists finalized deals to sell their publishing rights. It was reported in late December that Justin Bieber exchanged his <a href=#>music catalog for $200 million to Hipgnosis Songs Capital</a> –the biggest acquisition in the company’s history.</p><p>This allowed the pop start to nearly double his net worth. Justin was reportedly worth $285 million prior to the deal. Justin Timberlake similarly <a href=#>sold his publishing rights for $100 million</a> earlier in the year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In November, it was reported that Iggy Azalea sold her music catalogs for eight-figures. She defended her decision on Twitter.</p><p>“ <a href=#>I sold a portion of my catalog</a> to who I wanted, for an amount that means I don’t have to work another day in my life,” the rapper wrote.</p><p>Iggy is reportedly stepping away from music for the time being to focus on other projects, which likely includes her record label, Bad Dreams, that she founded several years ago.</p><p>One artist who’s reportedly negotiating a music catalog sale is Dr. Dre. In January, reports said that he was finalizing two <a href=#>separate deals, valued at $200 million altogether</a>.</p><p>Currently, the record for the most expensive music rights acquisition belongs to Bruce Springsteen, who <a href=#>sold his catalog for $500 million in 2021</a>. However, should Michael Jackson’s estate go through with the deal, it will likely surpass the record by hundreds of millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kanye West’s $2.2 Million LA Ranch Is Abandoned & Dilapidated</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Variety</a>, <a href=#>Marca</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6qq%2FHmpylZZqWsKy%2FzqeqZqWlqLakecKaq5qkn5x6tbuMrJylpF2bvLN5l2lnZnFgZXqutculoKimXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emmys-twitter-mistakes-terrence-howard-for-cuba-gooding-jr.html><span>←</span><span>Emmys Twitter Mistakes Terrence Howard for Cuba Gooding Jr.</span></a>
