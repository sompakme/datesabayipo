With a stellar cast, this movie follows a detective as he investigates the death of the patriarch of an eccentric and wild family, and no suspects are being ruled out. Of course, these types of films always stack the roster, so we're here to settle the score.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 10 Highest Grossing Films of 2019</a></span></p><p>In case you're wondering which one of these brilliant actors or actresses has raked in the most dough, you no longer have to. Here are the top 10 cast members from the show and their net worth, ranked (according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>).</p><h2 id=ana-de-armas---4-million>Ana de Armas - $4 Million</h2><p>Ana de Armas is only recently making waves in Hollywood, so we definitely expect her net worth to shoot through the roof in the next couple of years. You probably know this bombshell best from&nbsp;Blade Runner 2049,&nbsp;but she was also recently in&nbsp;War Dogs, The Informer,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Overdrive.&nbsp;Also, she has 5 movies in post-production or filming, so we know she isn't done. This talented and beautiful gal plays Marta Cabrera in this flick, and we know you loved her through every scene.</p><h2 id=katherine-langford---5-million>Katherine Langford - $5 Million</h2><p>It's no secret that this young and rising actress got her breakout through her starring role as Hannah Baker on&nbsp;13 Reasons Why.&nbsp;However, she's recently jumped over to film, and had a lead role in&nbsp;Love, Simon (2018).&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Cast Member Of 13 Reasons Why's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>She has another movie coming out soon, and is apparently part of a new television series, too. Of course, this young woman's net worth is definitely far from final, and we expect more incredible things from her.</p><h2 id=michael-shannon---8-million>Michael Shannon - $8 Million</h2><p>This actor is definitely no newbie to the big screen. Nominated for 2 Oscars and with 95 acting credits under his belt, he's a veteran choice for&nbsp;Knives Out.&nbsp;This man's net worth comes from a ton of secondary roles in movies, including&nbsp;Man of Steel, Loving, The Shape of Water, Nocturnal Animals,&nbsp;and many more. Obviously, he brings some incredible talent to this flick, and we know he has some more projects coming soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=toni-collette---18-million>Toni Collette - $18 Million</h2><p>This Oscar-nominated actress is also one of our all-time favs. You probably know her best from&nbsp;About a Boy&nbsp;or&nbsp;Little Miss Sunshine,&nbsp;but most recently, this woman's net worth has been shooting up because of her role in&nbsp;Velvet Buzzsaw, Hereditary,&nbsp;and many more. She also has some more flicks in the works, so we're definitely excited to see more of this talented gal. Of course, she's also a pretty perfect Joni Thrombey in this crime masterpiece.</p><h2 id=christopher-plummer---20-million>Christopher Plummer - $20 Million</h2><p>We don't have to tell you that this veteran actor is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a legend in the industry</a>. With 1 Oscar to show for it, this man has over 200 acting credits. Clearly, this flick was not his first. Most recently, this man has done quite a bit of voice acting, but we know you recognize him (most recently) from&nbsp;All the Money in the World&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cliffs of Freedom.&nbsp;Honestly, we're surprised his net worth isn't higher, but clearly he's been in the business for a long time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=don-johnson---40-million>Don Johnson - $40 Million</h2><p>This man also has almost 100 acting credits to show for his career. Most recently, you probably recognize him from&nbsp;Django Unchained, Dragged Across Concrete,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Book Club.&nbsp;Of course, his most iconic role is probably as the detective from&nbsp;Miami Vice&nbsp;in the '80s. Obviously, this man isn't done acting, and we love his versatility and talent. He was a perfect Richard Drysdale in this crime flick, and we're excited to see what else will contribute to this man's growing net worth.</p><h2 id=jamie-lee-curtis---60-million>Jamie Lee Curtis - $60 Million</h2><p>We think everyone knows this brilliant and hilarious woman, right? Of course, we know her best from&nbsp;Freaky Friday&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Halloween&nbsp;series. Most recently, she actually returned for the newest flick from this franchise.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Expensive Purchases Made By Chris Evans</a></span></p><p>However, she's also dabbled in television, such as&nbsp;Scream Queens&nbsp;and&nbsp;New Girl.&nbsp;Of course, this net worth is not surprising, and this gal has four more flicks in the works (and yes, two of these are part of the Halloween franchise).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-evans---70-million>Chris Evans - $70 Million</h2><p>It's pretty obvious that most of this whopping net worth is from this talented man's role as America's favorite ass (AKA Captain America). However, this man is also super versatile and brilliant, and has joined many different rom-coms, dramas, and action flicks. Most recently, you probably know him from&nbsp;Gifted, Before We Go,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Red Sea Diving Resort. And, you know, all the Avengers stuff.&nbsp;While he's hanging up his infamous shield, we know this man isn't done showing us what he's made of, and this role was absolutely made for this brilliant man.</p><h2 id=frank-oz---80-million>Frank Oz - $80 Million</h2><p>This man is honestly a legend, and we know you probably recognize his voice more than his face. In fact, he almost exclusively does voice acting. That's right, this is the man behind Yoda, but he's also Grover and the Cookie Monster for all <a href=#>Sesame Street</a> related projects. Obviously, it's not surprising that his net worth is what it is. Still, director Rian Johnson decided to let this man finally show his face, and he plays Alan Stevens in this crime flick. However, he'll always be Yoda in our hearts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daniel-craig---130-million>Daniel Craig - $130 Million</h2><p>It's also probably not surprising to see this man at the top of the list. Obviously, being in a bunch of James Bond flicks <a href=#>as 007 himself</a> really racks up your net worth. Of course, he's been in a handful of Bond films, including&nbsp;Skyfall&nbsp;and Spectre,&nbsp;and&nbsp;will be appearing again in the upcoming&nbsp;No Time to Die.&nbsp;However, he's also been in many other dramas, and even has one in production now. He's certainly made a name for himself in Hollywood, and we know he isn't done yet. This legendary actor was the perfect detective as Benoit Blanc in this incredible "who dunnit" crime mystery.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Richest Hunger Games Cast Members, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4r7XVnqpmp6Wpeq%2Bx02auqKqknXqurcinZJyZo6l6s63NpJydZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./huell-howser-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Huell Howser Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
