(Gomez has a long history with the Kardashian-Jenner family full of ups and downs, with tension suspected due to Jenner’s friendship with <strong>Hailey Bieber</strong> [née Baldwin].)</p><p>Gomez attended the Golden Globes on Sunday in support of her Hulu show, <a href=#>Only Murders in the Building</a>. She was nominated in the Best Actress in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy category for her role as Mabel Mora in the series. Gomez lost to <strong>Ayo Edebiri</strong>, who took home the award for her performance as Sydney Adamu in <a href=#>The Bear</a>.</p><p>Chalamet was also up for a Golden Globe, earning a nod in the Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy category for his role in Wonka. <strong>Paul Giamatti</strong>, who played Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, walked away with the win.</p><p>While Jenner didn’t pose with her boyfriend on the red carpet at the event, she joined Chalamet inside the venue, where the twosome were caught kissing. (The pair were first linked in April 2023 and have “<a href=#>a very special connection</a>,” per a source.)</p><p>Gomez previously worked with Chalamet on the 2019 movie <a href=#>A Rainy Day in New York</a>, and the costars seemingly stayed friends afterward.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In 2020, Chalamet even appeared on an Instagram Live with Gomez to discuss the presidential election.</p><p>“I’m really proud of you,” Chalamet told Gomez at the time, yelling, “Selena for President, 2024,” at another point during the stream. “You’ve been all over this stuff and I know it’s making a difference. I feel like you’re really on the curve … and it’s really important. I’m inspired.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoZ2kwamxxGaaoZmclrqmwIywnKKfmKh6qrqMqKVmq5Whsq%2BtjKCmpp2qYri6uMieZKOdnqOys3nDq5immV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./selena-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Selena Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
