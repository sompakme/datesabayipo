Despite being Shep’s ex, <a href=#>JT doesn’t appear to be shy about how much he likes Taylor</a>, 28.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In fact, Craig told Us in September that JT’s “obsession” with Taylor <a href=#>is how her rumored hookup with Austen first comes to light on the show</a>. “Because JT [is] telling Shep that he likes Taylor and Shep’s like, ‘Sure, sure, whatever. OK, JT, you can Taylor.’ And he’s like, ‘So that’s why I’m jealous of all the time she’s been spending with Austen,’” Craig recalled to Us about the drama, which took place earlier this year. “And Shep’s like, ‘Well, what do you mean by that?’”</p><p>Austen and Taylor sparked romance speculation in March after their respective splits from<a href=#> <strong>Olivia Flowers</strong></a> and Shep in 2022. On the season 9 premiere, <a href=#>which aired on September 14</a>, Taylor warned viewers “don’t believe everything you read on the internet,” denying the hookup. Austen, however, confessed to his parents that “something happened” with Taylor despite his friendship with Shep.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6erF2pvG63zaiuZqufqsGpsdGnZJygkae6tHnJmqmrnaSpeqvAjK2fqKWRqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fans-think-that-this-is-the-most-overrated-sitcom-ever.html><span>←</span><span>Fans Think That This Is The Most Overrated Sitcom Ever</span></a>
