Pregnant <strong>Arianny Celeste</strong> is “so happy” that she and her boyfriend, <strong>Taylor King</strong>, have a son on the way.</p><p>“He can protect his sibling, maybe even [be] a UFC fighter,” the model, 34, exclusively tells Us Weekly. “I felt like I knew that he was going to be a boy. I always wanted an older brother but didn’t have one, so I’m happy.”</p><p>The Las Vegas native is “excited” to welcome her first child, as well as “a little nervous.” While her pregnancy is “flying by,” Celeste is working on her baby-to-be’s room.</p><p>“We have a nest being built and will be done within a few weeks,” the UFC star tells Us. “We are going to start moving right before he arrives so we can move in after I give birth.”</p><p>The Overhaulin‘ cohost, who is eating In-N-Out [Burger] “once a week at least,” <a href=#>exclusively told Us last month that she is pregnant.</a></p><p>“I was super tired the first trimester, which made me feel down since I’m always&nbsp;on the go,” Celeste said in June. “That changed by week 14 when I got my energy back. My sense of smell was superhuman but thankfully I&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;too sick or nauseous. I crave fruit and meat. I’m not&nbsp;usually a meat eater and I stick to a mostly vegan diet, but during pregnancy, I’ve given&nbsp;in to occasionally eating things like pizza.”</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Girlfriend Box</a> founder told Us that she is due on September 28, adding at the time: “I am reading every&nbsp;book possible from what to eat, how to ‘sleep train’ and hypnobirthing. I want to be as informed as possible to have a harmonious journey with my baby.&nbsp;<a href=#>I plan on a&nbsp;hospital birth</a> with my boyfriend. His energy is so calming so&nbsp;I feel safe,&nbsp;yet confident. I’m&nbsp;determined to focus on the&nbsp;wonderful/empowering experience of birthing life to&nbsp;my&nbsp;first child.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Celeste’s <a href=#>gender reveal</a> maternity shoot, from solo shots to PDA pictures with King.</p><p>With reporting by Meagan Sargent</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkvbOxxqeYp6xdlr%2Bqrc2nsGablaGytMDEZqmerpWWubR50p6vZqeWYn60wIycn6KklGK6osDEq6WirKliwKm7zq1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mick-lombardi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Mick Lombardi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
