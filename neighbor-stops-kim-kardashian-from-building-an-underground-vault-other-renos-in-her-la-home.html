Keys expressed concern this will affect the environment of the entire community and may even pose a safety risk to the resident.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Moving forward, these two development project may cause loss of life,” the lawsuit read.</p><p>Kim originally purchased the estate with her husband <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye West</a> in 2014 for $20 million. The mansion itself spans 15,667 square feet and features eight bedrooms and ten bathrooms. It sits on a 3.01-acre property. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, the couple purchased the home from Lisa Marie Presley, the only child of rock n’ roll legend <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elvis Presley</a>.</p><p>Kim and Kanye spent almost five years remodeling the home after purchasing it. The renovations were finally finished in April 2019, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail </a>reports, though the pair had previously moved in with their four children in December 2017 after living at Kim’s mother Kris Jenner’s home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple spent approximately $20 million on updating the mansion, which included adding a swimming pool and full basketball court to the estate. After the renovations were completed, the property was worth approximately $60 million.</p><p>However, Kim filed for divorce earlier this year in February after six years of marriage. Reports claim that the rapper lives full-time at his $14 million Wyoming ranch, while Kim remains in the L.A. home they originally purchased together.</p><p>The couple’s break-up may have been the motivating factor in Kim’s decision to renovate the Hidden Hills property even further. It’s unclear how much the reality star’s planned additions will cost. But with the new lawsuit hanging over her head, it remains to see if she can even move forward with the renovation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forever Diamond NY Sees Spike In Sales After Britney Spears' Engagement</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo!
