"[But] I needed to pay my mortgage. It wasn't an option. I had to do the role."</p><p>Not only that, Farmiga was nervous about having to seduce <strong>George Clooney</strong> when she was nursing and struggling to drop post-pregnancy weight.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"It was strange having to portray that frank sexuality when I did not feel sexy in the least bit," Farmiga says. "But that's what I loved about her. I loved how daring she was. She makes sex, on screen, fun. She was curious and was gliding through life with grace and a sense of humor, and wit and self-possession and open-heartedness and femininity and sensuality and sexuality."</p><p>Critics have praised her work, and Farmiga just hopes it means the studio doesn't regret casting her — a fear she had while meeting with executives throughout her pregnancy.</p><p>"We met when I was four months pregnant, six months pregnant, eight months pregnant," Farmiga says. "The studio was panicking. I felt that. And it destroyed me. I wanted to walk away from this career. I felt incredibly insecure."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGavnaKWeqet0aagoJldna6lecyir56cXZuyprjIp56sZZaeua61zaBkrqhdnrtuwMeeZJqhomLBuLuMsJyeo6NirqfAxKtkoKGmnruoecGiqa2gXWd9cnyRbGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shep-rose-net-worth-how-much-is-rose-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Shep Rose Net Worth How Much is Rose Worth?</span></a>
