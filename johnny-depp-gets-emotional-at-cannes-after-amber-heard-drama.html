The <a href=#>Oscar nominee</a> was spotted waving to the moviegoers from the balcony in the theater amid the prolonged ovation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Johnny-Depp-Gets-Emotional-After-7-Minute-Standing-Ovation-at-Cannes-in-His-1st-Public-Appearance-Since-Amber-Heard-Legal-Battle-2.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Edward Scissorhands actor</a>’s arrival at Cannes marked his inaugural event since <a href=#>making headlines for his messy split from Heard</a>, 37, and his subsequent 2022 defamation lawsuit against the Aquaman actress.</p><p>Depp sued Heard — whom he was married to from 2015 to 2017 — in 2019 after she called herself a victim of domestic violence in an op-ed for <a href=#>The Washington Post</a>. While the Zombieland actress didn’t mention the Nightmare on Elm Street actor by name, <a href=#>Depp filed a lawsuit against her claiming she slandered his name</a> with the piece.</p><p>The exes went to court in 2022 and proceeded to claim during their respective testimonies that <a href=#>the other was abusive amid their marriage</a>. In June of that year,<a href=#> a jury ruled in Depp’s favor</a> and ordered Heard to pay him $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages. The Texas native, for her part, was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages.</p><p>Both parties later filed appeals to overturn the verdict, but in December 2022 <a href=#>they settled the lawsuit</a>.</p><p>“After a great deal of deliberation, I have made a very difficult decision to settle the defamation case brought against me by my ex-husband in Virginia,” Heard wrote in an Instagram statement at the time. “It’s important for me to say that I never chose this. I defended my truth and in doing so my life as I knew it was destroyed.”</p><p>She added: “This is not an act of concession. There are no restrictions or gags with respect to my voice moving forward.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following the controversial trial, Depp’s appearance at Cannes raised eyebrows with some who argued that his presence at the festival sent the wrong message. The Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald actor, however, wasn’t the only member of the Jeanne Du Barry team who received negative press ahead of Cannes.</p><p>The movie’s director and star, <strong>Maïwenn</strong>, who portrays Louis XV’s last mistress, Jeanne Du Barry, made waves in May after she <a href=#>confessed to spitting in the face of Mediapart magazine’s editor-in-chief</a> <strong>Edwy Plenel</strong> three months prior. Maïwenn <a href=#>reportedly walked up to Plenel at a restaurant</a>, grabbed him by the hair and spit in his face after his magazine published a report that multiple women had accused her ex-husband Luc Besson, of rape. Plenel has since sued the director over the incident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGooJ6jxm6wxKmnZp%2BVqcBuscyoq6Knnpa5bq3TZpqapp6awG6txa2cq2WRoq%2BmvoyhnJqqlGKxs63MmmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./here-s-what-we-know-about-the-show.html><span>←</span><span>Here's What We Know About The Show</span></a>
