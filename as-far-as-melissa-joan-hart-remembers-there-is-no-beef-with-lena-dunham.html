From 50 Cent and Madonna going at it on Instagram to the long-standing <a href=#>tension between Jennifer Lopez and Rosie Perez</a>, there is always some sort of drama happening in the Hollywood sphere. And while there is definitely some truth behind a lot of the beef celebrities get into, sometimes the people of the internet get it wrong, mishear or misread something, and suddenly there is a rumor being spread that confuses and amuses even the celebrities involved in them. There are even pages that exist purely to speculate on celebrity relationships just to gain attention or clout from whatever tale they are trying to weave that week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is likely why fans were surprised to hear about an alleged beef between '90s sweetheart Melissa Joan Hart and writer/actress Lena Dunham, a situation that both Hart and Dunham took the time to address to their fans.</p><h2 id=rumors-of-an-alleged-quot-beef-quot-surfaced-on-reddit>Rumors Of An Alleged "Beef" Surfaced On Reddit</h2><p>The rumors of a beef between Melissa Joan Hart and Lena Dunham began to gain traction on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">r/Duexmoi</a> subreddit. DeuxMoi is known among celebrity "tea spilling" and gossip circles, primarily for their posts on Instagram and their community on Reddit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="All The Rappers Nicki Minaj Has Beef With">All The Rappers Nicki Minaj Has Beef With</a></span></p><p>A screenshot of what appears to be an email sent to DeuxMoi shows an anonymous sender saying they can confirm that Melissa Joan Hart has it out for Lena Dunham, saying that the pair have been "frenemies for a long time" because Dunham's father was allegedly friends with the creator of the '90s hit show Clarissa Explains It All, in which Melissa Joan Hart played the titular character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The email continues on to say "Melissa has a knack for alienating people in her life-they disappear like magic. Her views are controversial (and chaotic) and she gets really argumentative about them. I didn't see the Instagram story but it's common knowledge in both of their circles that they've been beefing for a while."</p><p>And while it is known in online circles that DeuxMoi does not exactly fact-check or verify the content it publishes, Redditors were still quick to eat up the information that was posted, with many siding with Lena Dunham because of Melissa Joan Hart's conservative views.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=melissa-joan-hart-says-she-and-dunham-haven-39-t-even-met>Melissa Joan Hart Says She And Dunham Haven't Even Met</h2><p>Melissa Joan Hart was quick to repost the screenshots shared by DeuxMoi to her own Instagram and put in her two cents on the rumor. Melissa Joan Hart said "numerous friends" had taken the time to ask her about her alleged beef with Dunham, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interactions which left her feeling confused by the entire situation</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Has Melissa Joan Hart's Career Choices Negatively Impacted Her Net Worth? ">Has Melissa Joan Hart's Career Choices Negatively Impacted Her Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>Her post on Instagram reads "So I don't normally pay any attention to the tabloid rumor mill but numerous friends have asked me about my 'rivalry' with @lenahunham and I'm truly confused. We have no 'beef', and as far as I remember, we haven't had the pleasure of meeting, let alone having enough of a relationship to warrant any time to discuss drag queens."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It continues on to say "Don't let them get you with flashy links as they pretend to give you hot gossip that doesn't exist. I'm a fan of Lena's work and all that she does to support females in our industry and hope to share a latte someday. Please be careful not to get caught up in the hateful rhetoric of these sites that promote division and spew crap to make a profit."</p><p>Fans of Melissa Joan Hart were sure to flood the comment section of her post to show their support for the television star, with many saying they knew the rumors were false the entire time, and some saying that her views are neither chaotic nor controversial.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lena-dunham-also-appeared-confused-by-the-reports>Lena Dunham Also Appeared Confused By The Reports</h2><p>Lena Dunham was also quick to address the rumored beef between her and Melissa Joan Hart. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On an episode of the Who? Weekly podcast</a>, Dunham was quick to squash the rumor as well, telling the participants of the show "I'm not in a feud with anyone."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Lena Dunham Helped Launch Adam Driver’s Movie Career">How Lena Dunham Helped Launch Adam Driver’s Movie Career</a></span></p><p>She continues on to say that she lives in London and barely leaves her home, and even confirms that she and Melissa Joan Hart had never met before, saying that she has "never been in a room with her, never seen her," but did watch all of Clarissa Explains It All and Sabrina The Teenage Witch, both roles that Melissa Joan Hart is most known for</p><p>Dunham admits that the only reason she even knew about the alleged beef was that Melissa Joan Hart spoke out against the alleged feud first. So while it may appear that <a href=#>several celebrities are not huge fans of Lena Dunham</a>, it is safe to currently say that Melissa Joan Hart is not one of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is no doubt that both of these ladies have enough on their plates to keep them busy enough to avoid a feud, with Lena Dunham focusing heavily on her producing career, and Melissa Joan Hart <a href=#>continuing her career in acting while also running her own small business</a>, but both of them handled this rumor with respect and courtesy for themselves and each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dorKttdKsmGain5a7brTAq6tmmZ6Zeq2xzZpkna2ena6uecWerJ2hnpx8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-wintour-news-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Wintour News - Us Weekly</span></a>
