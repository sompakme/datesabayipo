Of course, the main reason why people have talked about him is Pratt’s role in the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> and the Jurassic World films. On top of his most famous movie roles, Pratt has also gotten himself embroiled in several controversies in recent years. On the lighter side of things, people were <a href=#>pissed that Pratt was cast in the lead role for an upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie</a>. More importantly, a lot of people have taken exception to or greatly support Pratt’s perceived political leanings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that Chris Pratt is a major movie star, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that his romantic life has garnered a huge amount of attention over the years. For example, people were fascinated when it was learned that Pratt was set to get married a second time. Despite that, a lot of Pratt’s fans seem to know very little about Pratt’s current wife other than the fact that she is married to the movie star.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Brie Larson And Chris Pratt Receive The Most Hate From 'MCU' Fans</a></span></p><h2 id=pratt-rsquo-s-past-relationships>Pratt’s Past Relationships</h2><p>Before he got involved with the woman he now calls his wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Pratt was romantically linked to a handful of other women</a>. For example, from 2004 until 2006, Pratt was known to be dating Emily VanCamp, an actor who would go on to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Sharon Carter, a character otherwise known as Agent 13. In addition to both actors appearing in the MCU, Pratt and VanCamp had another interesting connection, they played brother and sister in the show Everwood throughout their time together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to his relationship with Emily VanCamp, Chris Pratt was also rumored to be involved with another Marvel Cinematic Universe actor. After all, according to reports, Pratt was rumored to be romantically linked to Pom Klementieff in 2018. For anyone who doesn’t recognize Klementieff by name, they are likely to be aware of her most famous character since she played Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and a pair of Avengers movies. Of course, it has to be noted that the supposed romance that Pratt and Klementieff shared has never been confirmed by either of them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chris Pratt Killed Off In 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3' By Marvel Fans</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, the most notable relationship that Chris Pratt was a part of before meeting his current wife was with the woman he married in the past, Anna Faris. During their marriage, Pratt and Faris were commonly perceived as one of the most beloved couples in Hollywood. Sadly, things aren’t always as rosy as they seem from the outside looking in and ultimately Pratt and Faris wound up going their separate ways with their divorce being finalized in 2018. On the bright side, it certainly seems like Anna has found happiness just like Pratt as <a href=#>Faris recently eloped with the cinematographer Michael Barrett</a>. Pratt and Faris will also always have a role in one another’s lives as they share a son named Jack</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Do Chris Pratt And Anna Faris Still Talk?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pratt-rsquo-s-wife>Pratt’s Wife</h2><p>Born into a family that was overflowing with celebrities, Katherine Schwarzenegger was the oldest child of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver. Of course, anyone who has even a passing knowledge of Hollywood from the last few decades will know the name Arnold since he is one of the biggest movie stars of all time. Shriver also is an extremely accomplished person based on her highly successful journalism career. Through her mom, Katherine is also related to the Kennedy family since Maria is the niece of JFK, RFK, and Ted Kennedy.</p><p>Of course, Katherine Eunice Schwarzenegger Pratt is more than just the child of Arnold and Maria Shriver as well as the wife of Chris Pratt. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katherine is her own person who has accomplished impressive things</a>. For example, Katherine is a staunch supporter of the Best Friends Animal Society and animal rights in general. As a result, Katherine has been named an American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ambassador.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to her work on behalf of animals, Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt is an author who has published four books to date. First off, Katherine wrote a book in which she tackled body image issues titled “Rock What You've Got: Secrets to Loving Your Inner and Outer Beauty from Someone Who's Been There and Back”. Then, following her graduation from the University of Southern California in 2012, Katherine sought out advice from many notable people and compiled them into her next book, “I Just Graduated . . . Now What?”. Next, Katherine combined her love of the written word and her devotion to animals when she published “Maverick and Me”, a children’s book in which she chronicled the benefits of pet adoption.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After writing and releasing her first three books, Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt put together her most impressive work to date. After all, it is amazing that Katherine sought out interviews with and earned the trust of 22 people who’d gone through extreme trauma like including Elizabeth Smart and the sister of Nicole Brown-Simpson. Katherine then compiled everything she’d learned from those people into her book “The Gift of Forgiveness: Inspiring Stories from Those Who Have Overcome the Unforgivable”. In addition to all of the books she has published, Katherine also finds the time to operate a lifestyle blog.</p><p>When it comes to Katherine’s private life, it had been reported that she met her husband Chris Pratt through her mother Maria Shriver. However, during interviews, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pratt has stated that he met Katherine in church</a>. No matter how they found each other, it is known that Katherine and Pratt married in 2019 and they welcomed their daughter into the world in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger Shares Sweet Birthday Message To Daughter Katherine</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBur8eroKxloKeutcDSZq6inpViuKLAx56poqaVYsCktNaaqbOdnpq0qLHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-evelin-barajas-perez-nypd-identify-staten-island-woman-stabbed-at-home.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Evelin Barajas Perez?
