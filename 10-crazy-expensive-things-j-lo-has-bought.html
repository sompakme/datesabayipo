Most likely, back then she couldn't imagine that she would have multiple homes in Miami, Bel Air and New York, and they're all worth millions. In 2016, she bought a mansion in Bel Air for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$28 million</a>. The place has eight bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, a garden that resembles a jungle, a swimming pond, and even a bridge.</p><p>The singer loves enormous properties, which can be a problem sometimes.

She is naturally beautiful, but she doesn't get it all from her good genes. Once a week, the singer spends $1.200 ($4.800 per month) in a human <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">placenta facial mask</a>. Specialists claim that the placenta is full of vitamins and powerful rejuvenescent since it helps skin regeneration. The mask is applied on the face, earlobes, and eyelids. It stimulates the production of collagen and elastin.</p><p>Although this sounds strange, other celebrities like Kim Kardashian are fans of the treatment as well.</p><h2 id=romantic-holidays>Romantic Holidays</h2><p>Paris is one of the best choices if you are looking for a romantic destination. In 2017, J.Lo and Alex Rodriguez traveled to Paris and other cities in France during the summer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Gossip Girl’s Entire Cast Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple is very much in love and shared many pictures of their holidays on social media.

As Tracy Anderson told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWD</a>, “She gives so much and she’s not one of these performers who think they’re just entitled to a good body and is jumping for all kinds of quick fixes. She’s very aware of finding her own formula and what works for her along the way.”</p><h2 id=weddings>Weddings</h2><p>This year, Jennifer Lopez will get married to Alex Rodriguez, and it'll be the fourth time that the singer walks down the aisle. She got married the first time in 1998, in a simple ceremony.</p><p>However, she went the extra mile when she walked in the aisle for the second time and had to spend lots of money to assure her privacy. As her ex-husband Cris Judd said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our privacy is breached. You're no longer a normal person. Our wedding was a circus. I think several people got arrested trying to climb up a mountain, trying to sneak in. We actually rented the airspace."
