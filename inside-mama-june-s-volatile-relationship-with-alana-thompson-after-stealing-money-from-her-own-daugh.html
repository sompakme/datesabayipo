Years after finding fame on the TLC reality series Toddlers and Tiaras and then Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, she <a href=#>opened up about being a child star</a> and admitted that it has been super tough. Alana's fights with her mother June "Mama June" Shannon have been highly publicized as the two continue to appear on various reality shows. Since Alana and Mama June argue so much, fans wonder <a href=#>if Alana has a good bond with her sisters</a>.</p><p>Since Alana became successful at such a young age, people are curious about <a href=#>how Alana spends her net worth</a>. Her financial situation was in the news in the spring of 2024 when fans learned that <strong>Mama June stole money from Alana Thompson</strong>. According to TV Shows Ace, Mama June will give Alana the money she took from her bank account, which is <strong>reportedly $33,000 or $35,000</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this article, we'll take a look at<strong> Mama June and Alana Thompson's relationship </strong>after this intense situation, along with <strong>why Mama June took her daughter's reality TV earnings</strong>.</p><h2 id=what-is-mama-june-and-alana-thompson-39-s-relationship-like-today>What Is Mama June And Alana Thompson's Relationship Like Today?</h2><p>Thanks to Mama June and Alana Thompson's huge fight about Alana's reality TV earnings that were in a Coogan bank account, <strong>the mother/daughter have a difficult relationship today</strong>.

It's pretty harsh for a young adult to say that they don't want their parent to see them at college.</p><p>According to City National Bank, a Coogan bank account is when a guardian or parent of a child star puts their earnings into a bank account so they can access the money when they are of legal adult age.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-Sad-Truth-About-Honey-Boo-Boo-And-Mama-Junes-Weight-Loss.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Sad Truth About Honey Boo Boo And Mama June's Weight Loss</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>In July of 2022, it was revealed that Honey Boo Boo is going to undergo endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty before her 17th birthday.</span><p>The reality stars have a sad history of not getting along and they have experienced some truly hard times. <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alana's sister Lauryn won custody</a> of her</strong> a few years back.

She thought that Alana wanted to live with her sister. She said, “People don’t understand the custody thing. It’s not like somebody ‘lost custody.’ In the state of Georgia, you do temporary guardianship every year and [Alana] had been with [Lauryn] in my addiction. Well, at the age of 12, you’re able to make your choice."</p><h2><img alt="Alana Thompson and mama June" data-image-id=213563 data-mobile-optimized=true height=628 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-Sad-Truth-About-Honey-Boo-Boo-And-Mama-Junes-Weight-Loss.jpg width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p>While Alana Thompson didn't seem pleased with Mama June because of their money stealing scandal, Mama June didn't say anything negative about her daughter.

She said:</p><p>"Truth to be known, Pumpkin may be mad and I'm sorry and the world may be mad and think that I'm the worst person ever. I've lied to my children over the years. I've lied to them and told them that you can't get your money until you're 21 so they wouldn't blow through it."</p><p>However, while it seems clear that Mama June spent the money that her daughter earned from her reality TV days, Mama June did say quite a few times on Mama June: Family Crisis that there was still some money in the bank account.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Honey Boo Boo's Family Members</p></th><th scope=col><p>Net Worths</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Alana Thompson/Honey Boo Boo</p></td><td><p>$100,000 (via Celebrity Net Worth)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>June Shannon/Mama June</p></td><td><p>$100,000 (via Celebrity Net Worth)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lauryn "Pumpkin" Efird</p></td><td><p>$200,000 (via Celebrity Net Worth)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jessica Shannon</p></td><td><p>unknown</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Anna "Chickadee" Cardwell</p></td><td><p>$1 million at time of death (via Showbiz Cheat Sheet)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also claimed that <strong>Alana can access the money when she's older</strong>.
