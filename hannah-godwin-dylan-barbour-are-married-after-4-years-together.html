Although Godwin initially showed interest in <a href=#><strong>Blake Horstmann</strong></a>, her connection with Barbour was ultimately stronger and the twosome <a href=#>got engaged</a> during the show’s season finale.</p><p>Following their time on the ABC series, the couple had a long distance relationship while Godwin was located in Los Angeles and the tech entrepreneur was residing in San Diego. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the duo found themselves <a href=#>unexpectedly quarantined together</a> in March 2020.</p><p>“Luckily, we’re both easygoing so being trapped in sweats all day with my BFF isn’t a bad day,” Godwin exclusively told Us Weekly in March 2020. Barbour, for his part, added, “It makes us want to live together and puppy fever is through the roof.”</p><p>In November 2020, the pair&nbsp;<a href=#>moved into a home together</a> in San Diego. “Forever roomie,” Godwin wrote via<a href=#> Instagram</a> at the time. “Moved into our new zip code today, more decor content coming soooon 🙂 Thanks for all the positive vibes.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hannah-godwin-and-dylan-barbour-married-1.jpg><p>Throughout the years, the twosome have not been shy about sharing their love of each other on social media.</p><p>“To the guy who wins me over every year,” Godwin wrote via<a href=#> Instagram</a> in June 2022 alongside a photo of the couple. “Happy birthday @dylanbarbour.”&nbsp;Barbour, meanwhile, posted his <a href=#>own sweet message</a> for Godwin’s birthday in February 2022.</p><p>“You’re the most loving, caring and selfless woman I’ve ever met,” he gushed. “You focus your energy on anyone and everyone you come across, and you know how to light up a room with your wit and humor. From launching your website and app (and it literally being on top trending charts) to walking in NYFW, it’s been a privilege to watch you accomplish your goals, and I know you’re just getting started. I love you and happy birthday. Like this photo if we should have 5 kids, comment for 6.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Bachelor Nation was introduced to Godwin when she appeared as a contestant on<a href=#><strong> Colton Underwood’s</strong> </a>season 23 of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> in 2019.
