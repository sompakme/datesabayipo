(A girl can dream, right?) While sweatsuits are off the table, <strong>Selena Gomez</strong> recently proved that you can stay cozy and look chic while out and about. The solution? A plush sweaterdress.</p><p>Last weekend, Gomez was spotted leaving the iconic BondST Sushi in New York City’s SoHo neighborhood with her famous girl gang. Her celeb pals, including <strong>Taylor Swift, Brittany Mahomes Sophie Turner </strong>and <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong>, went all out with their attire — wearing thigh-high boots, corset tops and miniskirts. Gomez, on the other hand, prioritized comfort — opting to wear a belted camel-colored sweaterdress designed with oversized sleeves and a turtleneck silhouette.</p><p>I was immediately inspired by the multi-hyphenate mega-star — we should not have to sacrifice comfort for style, even on special occasions! So I took to Amazon and found a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">similar style from Zesica</a> for under $50!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Taylor-Swift-Selena-Gomez-Gigi-Hadid-and-Sophie-Turner-are-seen-in-NoHo.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Zesica Women’s Turtleneck Sweater Midi Dress</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$49</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices and deals are accurate at the date of publication but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>This popular dress has garnered over 150 five-star reviews from happy customers who praise its <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">luxurious quality and comfy, cozy fabric</a>. Like the actress’s designer frock, the Zesica style comes in a warm camel color (a.k.a. one of fall’s hottest hues), and features billowy sleeves, a loose turtleneck and also includes a removable waist belt. We appreciate that the bodycon style beautifully hugs curves, but doesn’t feel restricting making it ideal for holiday get-togethers.</p><p>“I wanted a flattering, comfortable, warm dress. This was perfect,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one reviewer raves</a>. “It is super stretchy and way soft. I got several comments and people wanting to feel how soft it was!” Others confirm that although it has a slimmer, body-skimming fit,<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> it runs true to size</a> and doesn’t feel tight in the slightest.</p><p>In my eyes, wearing this dress is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">essentially like wearing your own personal blanket</a>, and who doesn’t love that? <a href=#>I will definitely be rocking this to Thanksgiving dinner</a>. If you’re not totally in love with this style, we found a few more options that emulate Gomez’s effortless style below!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Zesica Women’s Turtleneck Sweater Midi Dress</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$49</a> at Amazon!
