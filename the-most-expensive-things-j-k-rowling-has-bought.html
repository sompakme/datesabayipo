This writer has lived a fairly simple life following her fame, but there are some things she likes to splurge on.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Harry Potter:10 Richest Actors Who Played Muggles, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>We have compiled a list of some of the things that J.K. Rowling has decided to buy with her millions.&nbsp;She tends to sprinkle a bit of wizarding cheer in with some of her purchases as she loves the fantastical world as much as the rest of us. Keep reading to learn about the most expensive things J.K. Rowling has bought!</p><h2 id=yacht-19-2-million>Yacht ($19.2 Million)</h2><p>Rowling originally bought&nbsp;this yacht from Johnny Depp and she posted it for sale back in 2017. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She is asking</a> $19.2 million for it, or she is offering to rent it at a cost of&nbsp;$130,000 per week. It has a total of three decks that can sleep up to 10 people in four different bedrooms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are tons of water activities stored onboard like kayaks, snorkeling equipment, and even the stuff for them to go windsurfing. It might have been an expensive purchase, but one that Rowling and her family did enjoy.</p><h2 id=her-neighbor-s-house-2-million>Her Neighbor's House ($2&nbsp;Million)</h2><p>Rowling has a house in Edinburgh and she wanted to expand her garden, so she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bought her neighbor's house</a> for $1.6 million. She had it demolished to make room for her tree garden, which was obviously inspired by the series she wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Harry Potter: 10 Richest Actors Who Played Hogwarts Students, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>It cost $400,000 to make room for a tree garden. There were several protests from her neighbors regarding this addition regarding the landscape and view from the street, but Rowling won in the end and had them erected.</p><h2 id=designer-clothes-5-000>Designer Clothes ($5,000)</h2><p>J.K. Rowling might not <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wear fashion-forward outfits</a> every day of the week, but when she hits the red carpet she pulls out all of the stops. The most notable is an Oscar de la Renta gown from his 2011 collection, but the exact price of the gown hasn't been released.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We do know his high-end dresses tend to sell for around $5,000, so we can only assume that Rowling spent somewhere in this price range. She looks fantastic in it and it is only one of the ways she chooses to spend her money.</p><h2 id=her-own-charity-336-million>Her Own Charity ($336 Million)</h2><p>This a charity that Rowling started that aims to help children trapped in poor situations and orphanages be returned to their families or loving homes. It is unclear how much Rowling herself puts into the organization every year, but so far they have managed to use to create community services that keep children out of these horrible conditions. They have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">managed to take</a> $336 million and put it toward community programs that create a better world for us to live in.</p><h2 id=a-visit-to-the-hamptons-250-000>A Visit To The Hamptons ($250,000)</h2><p>J.K. Rowling loves to take vacations, especially with her family, and no expense is too much for her to pay. She decided to hit up the Hamptons back in 2006 and it was said that she would pay as much as $500,000 to stay in this area for two months.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Harry Potter: 10 Adorkable Photos Of The Kids Before They Were Famous</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily, she was able to barter a deal and managed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">snag a place in Bridgehampton</a> for only $250,000. There was not much talk about her activities, but we do know that she spent a great deal of her time swimming and hanging out with her family.</p><h2 id=luxury-jewelry-16-000>Luxury Jewelry ($16,000)</h2><p>It is no secret that Elizabeth Gage is Rowling's favorite jewelry designer. She has worn several rings, bracelets, and earrings from her collections, and they are all expensive. We don't know the exact prices of the pieces she bought, but if you peruse through the collections online you will find they cost about $16,000 apiece.</p><p>Rowling loves completing an outfit with a bit of shine which is <a href=#>exactly what this jewelry</a> gives her every time she puts it on.</p><h2 id=personal-security-150-000>Personal Security ($150,000)</h2><p>This writer's face is known all over the world, <a href=#>which is why she often travels</a> with a personal security team. They keep her safe in the crowds that tend to gather around her, or even help prevent the nuts from trying to enter her residence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She uses them for professional occasions, and on the off-chance, she needs someone to keep her safe from an obsessive fan. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We estimate</a> she spends about $150,000 on this, as they tend to cost between $500 and $1,000 a day, and she tries to only use them when necessary.</p><h2 id=a-home-in-edinburgh-2-9-million>A Home In Edinburgh ($2.9 Million)</h2><p>This author used to own a home in Edinburgh, but she sold it back in 2015. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It sold for</a> $2.9 million and it was magnificent. She moved here in 2009 and there are two-stories, as well as gardens, outhouses, and a huge office.</p><p>This was the same residence in which the tree garden was added, and it only gave the house greater value when it was finished. There were several books written at this residence, especially after she rose to fame and could no longer write in cafes. It was sad to see this property go, but she decided it wasn't private enough for her famous media presence.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Harry Potter: The Main Characters' Real Life Ages & Relationship Statuses</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nmqB6s7vWpaCnn12ssqK406FkpqejqXqmxM%2Bepayhppp6scHRnJ%2Baq5WoerW0yKeerGWSpMKotNNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ryan-gosling-hasn-t-been-invited-to-perform-barbie-song-at-oscars.html><span>←</span><span>Ryan Gosling Hasn't 'Been Invited' to Perform 'Barbie' Song at Oscars</span></a>
