And I don't want to see any more innocent, small children being affected this way,” she continued.</p><p>La Toya also questioned how many people would be okay with the idea of seeing a man share a bed with a minor for up to 30 days — she stressed that nobody she knew would’ve been okay with any adult sharing a bed with their child, so why was it okay for Michael to do this?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Now you stop and think for one second and you tell me, what 35-year-old man is going to take a little boy and stay with him for 30 days? And take another boy and stay with him for five days in a room and never leave the room?” she continued.</p><p>"How many of you out there are 35 years old? How many would take little kids and do that? That are 9, 10, 11 years old? I love my brother, but it's wrong. I don't want to see these kids hurt.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Does Jenna Dewan Maintain Such A Toned Body Post-Baby?
