The former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador became the first significant challenger to former <a href=#>President Donald Trump</a> for the 2024 Republican nomination.</p><p>The announcement was delivered in a tweeted video and included the following message, <strong>‚ÄúYou should know this about me. I don‚Äôt put up with bullies. And when you kick back, it hurts them more if you‚Äôre wearing heels. I‚Äôm Nikki Haley, and I‚Äôm running for president.‚Äù</strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Get excited!

Therefore, parents, an essential part of one‚Äôs existence, are at the top of the list of people whose lives are thoroughly scrutinized by the public.&nbsp;</p><p>The famous Republican politician‚Äôs parents are Ajit Singh Randhawa and Raj Kaur Randhawa. Both of them migrated from Punjab, India, to South Carolina.&nbsp;</p><p>Haley‚Äôs mother, Raj, studied law at the University of New Delhi. After moving to South Carolina, she got a master‚Äôs degree in education and taught in Bamberg public schools for seven years.</p><p>Her father, Ajit, earned a doctorate from the University of British Columbia and was a biology professor at Voorhees College for 29 years before retiring from teaching in 1998.</p><p>The Randhawas also operated a foreign goods store in Bamberg that grew into Exotica International, a clothing boutique. Haley helped with bookkeeping as a teenager.&nbsp;</p><p>The store closed in 2008 when Haley‚Äôs parents retired after 32 years of operating the <a href=#>business</a>, according to a press release from the company.</p><p>Nikki Haley was born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa. She has three siblings: two brothers, Mitti and Charan, and a sister, Simran.&nbsp;</p><p>Haley was raised Sikh and converted to Christianity before marrying her husband, Michael Haley, in 1996.&nbsp;</p><p>Nicki has frequently accepted her parents‚Äô Indian ethnicity proudly. She does not shy away from telling people that she is the proud daughter of Indian immigrants.&nbsp;</p><p>Nikki‚Äôs parents came to America and settled in a small Southern town. Her father wore a turban, and her mother wore a sari. She was a brown girl in a Black and white world.&nbsp;</p><p>According to her, she and her family faced discrimination and hardship, but her parents never gave in to grievance and hate.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC6yKSiomWYlrmmxYypmKudnqnAbrzHqKuoZZWtvbC%2FxKxkoZ2iYravsMiapWadpJ27qq%2FIrbBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julia-o-brien-net-worth-age-height-weight-family-wiki-2024.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Julia O'Brien Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</span></a>
