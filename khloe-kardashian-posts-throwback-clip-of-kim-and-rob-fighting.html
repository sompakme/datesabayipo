You have no manners.” Rob, 29, angrily replies, “You’re a whore. You have no manners.”</p><p>“I’m a whore?” she asks, before he responds, “You just called me a dick, so I’m going to say something right back.”</p><p>“He’s so immature,” Kim says, laughing. The siblings’ stepfather,&nbsp;<b>Bruce Jenner</b> (who transitioned into <b><a href=#>Caitlyn Jenner</a></b> last year), walks over, prompting Kim to call for backup. “As a dad, you should step in because he’s being disrespectful,” she tells Bruce.</p><p>“MOOD!!!” Khloé captioned the video on Saturday. “I wish all fights were like this. What were they even fighting about?”</p><p>Earlier in the week, <a href=#>Rob announced his engagement</a> to girlfriend <b>Blac Chyna</b> while the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner family boarded a private plane to Colorado. As <i>Us Weekly</i> <a href=#>previously reported</a>, they haven't publicly commented on the proposal and think Rob is “making a mistake.”</p><p>“Kris is not happy,” an insider told <i>Us</i>. “Dating Chyna is one thing, but marrying her is another … The whole family is discussing it and is angry, but they are talking to come up with a unified front for how to address it … It’s a huge mistake to them.”</p><p>Khloé hasn’t spoken out much about Rob and Chyna’s relationship, which started in late January. She recently said on an <a href=#>episode of <i>Kocktails With Khloé</i></a>&nbsp;that things are “very dramatic” between her and her brother’s girlfriend.</p><p>“It’s like a soap opera episode, so it sounds very dramatic, which it is,” she admitted. “But I actually haven’t seen Chyna in a few years, but her and I did not get into a fight, but I do love a good fight.”</p><p>A source <a href=#>told <i>Us</i><i></i> in January</a> that Khloé felt “majorly betrayed by Rob after she always stuck up for him. She feels like this is a major blow to the family. Nobody in the family likes it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoJyksm63wKubmquYnq6vec%2Boqq2rXam1s7vWm5ico12Yuaq8jKidZqOZonqiusNmqaiaXZu2qLTToqWgZadnfXN8mG1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-leopold-brodie-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>John Leopold Brodies biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</span></a>
