His photo, which finds the 29-year-old donning a Duke Blue Devils jersey, identical to a <a href=# rel=nofollow>famous photo of the hip-hop icon</a>, was first coupled with a simple caption, “Dad.” After receiving online commentary to the photo, Tyga expounded upon the one-word bombshell, sharing the story of his biological father.</p><p>“Pac taught me a lot more than my own father. Inspired me, Motivated Me, Listened without ever being there,” he wrote.</p><p>The rapper then went on to share that his father is now serving a life sentence in prison. In a screenshot of a letter his father wrote, he reveals to his son that his time in prison has sent him on a spiritual journey. Reflecting on spending 25 years inside, Tyga’s father assures him that he has been on a search for him. Tyga also shared his reply to the letter, in which he writes: “Things could’ve been different if you were around I’m sure. But I know life moves on and now I gotta teach my son to be a man. Even tho no one ever taught me how to be one.”</p><p>It seems Tyga’s appreciation for Tupac runs deeper than rap.
