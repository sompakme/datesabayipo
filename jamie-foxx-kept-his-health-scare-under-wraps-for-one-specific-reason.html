Over the years, Foxx has disclosed what he does for his diet and workout routines. What shocked many is that Foxx does not rely on a trainer or dietician to keep him in shape. Instead, Foxx shared that he stuck to a consistent bodyweight workout and ate a diet that was packed with lean meats, vegetables, and healthy carbs.</p><p><a href=#>Despite living a healthy lifestyle, Foxx suffered a health scare in April 2023</a>. Initially, the lack of information coming out about his condition left fans wondering just how serious things were with Foxx.

He waited until he was back to feeling healthy and looked well so that fans would not question Foxx's health status. As such, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was September 2023 before fans and the entertainment industry gained a glimpse into what Foxx endured</a> to regain his strength to live and work again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar51900197-1.jpg><p>"I know a lot of people were waiting or wanting to hear updates but to be honest with you, I just didn’t want you to see me like that, man," Foxx explained.</p><p>"I want you to see me laughing, having a good time, partying, cracking a joke, doing a movie, television show. I didn't want you to see me with tubes running out of me and trying to figure out if I was gonna make it through."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Foxx went on to say, "I cannot tell you how great it feels to have your family kick in in such a way, and y'all know they kept it airtight, they didn’t let nothing out, they protected me, and that’s what I hope that everyone could have in moments like these."</p><p>"I went to hell and back and my road to recovery had some potholes as well. But I'm coming back and I'm able to work," Foxx continued. "I thank the people who let me work and I just want to say that I love everybody. I love all the love that I got."</p><p>Foxx concluded, "It was tough, man, I was sick, but now I've got my legs under me, so you're going to see me out... I'm on my way back."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/your-paragraph-text-2024-01-23t202352-030.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Praised Jamie Foxx's "Composure" With Brie Larson's Outfit During Their Jimmy Kimmel Live Interview</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jamie Foxx held it together during his interview alongside Jimmy Kimmel's better looking replacement, Brie Larson.</span><p>Despite an explanation as to how he was feeling, Foxx did not disclose exactly what happened to him and has the months have gone on, there has been little discussed about what Foxx suffered from.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-heath-condition-jamie-foxx-suffered-from>What Heath Condition Jamie Foxx Suffered From</h2><h3 id=jamie-foxx-has-never-confirmed-what-it-was-that-caused-him-to-be-hospitalized>Jamie Foxx has never confirmed what it was that caused him to be hospitalized</h3><p>It was in April 2023, that the world first learned Foxx had been hospitalized. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Foxx's daughter announced via a statement</a> that Foxx had suffered a "medical complication" but did not go into further details.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar52031317-1.jpg><p>Foxx's representative confirmed that the "condition was serious enough that Jamie’s family, some of whom were not in town, came to the hospital." Again, details were not disclosed.</p><p>The lack of explanation led to several rumors about what occurred. From a COVID vaccine that led to a brain bleed that was vehemently shut down by those close to Foxx to suffering from a seizure, a blood clot in the brain, and even going blind and being paralyzed temporarily, the supposed facts about Foxx's health were all over the board.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jamie-foxx-lost-out-on-an-oscar-winning-role-in-jerry-maguire-because-he-couldn-t-resist-trying-to-impress-tom-cruise.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jamie Foxx's "Disappointing" Experience With Tom Cruise Changed His Career For The Better</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jamie Foxx blew his Jerry Maguire audition next to Tom Cruise.</span><p>Since the hospitalization, Foxx has never divulged just what it was he had to overcome to get back his health to be able to work and appear at Hollywood functions.

Everybody loves him," Diaz explained. "We have so much fun on the set with him, and he's just a professional on every level."</p><p>Diaz continued saying, "I love that guy so much. He's such a special person, and he's so talented, so much fun."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With shooting wrapped for the film, Foxx has already started moving on to his next projects.
