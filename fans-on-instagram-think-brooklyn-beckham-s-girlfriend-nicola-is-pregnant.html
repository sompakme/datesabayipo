He's been famous since he was born, and now&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has grown up into a successful young man, who only just turned 21.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's a huge mama's boy</a>, he has flown the nest, become an adult, and is&nbsp;now engaged to be married to his<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;girlfriend Nicola Peltz</a>. He might not have followed in his father's footsteps and became a footballer, but he might be following in the footsteps of his parents in another way.</p><p>Everyone knows that the Beckham's married young, shortly after meeting, and had a surprise in the form of Brooklyn before they got to walk down the aisle, but could their son be following that example?</p><p>Fans on Instagram who follow Peltz certainly think so. So is there another Beckham on the way for the young couple before they say, 'I do'?</p><h2 id=beckham-and-peltz-announced-their-engagement-just-a-month-ago>Beckham and Peltz Announced Their Engagement&nbsp;Just A Month Ago</h2><p>The first time we heard that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beckham was linked to Peltz was back in October 2019</a>. We weren't quite sure what the terms of their relationship were then but this past January gave us all the confirmation we needed that the pair were dating through an Instagram official&nbsp;debut from both of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the couple's debut post on January 2, Beckham shared three photos, one of Peltz covering her face with her hands, another of Beckham in bed, and one of the couple, posing for the camera. The only caption was a heart.&nbsp;Peltz commented similarly on her single photo featuring the pair in front of a mirror with Peltz taking the photo with her camera.</p><p>A week later, Beckham posts a birthday tribute to Peltz saying, "Happy Birthday babe." After that, both accounts sprinkled photos of them together here and there, and they&nbsp;were seen at Paris Fashion Week in February.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Secrets Of David Beckham's Marriage To Posh Spice</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beckham posted another picture of them commenting, "<span>I promise to always take care of you and to love you with all my heart," and Peltz posted the same picture with the caption, "u have my heart."</span></p><p>Nicola was center stage next to Beckham at his 21st birthday party in March, and the couple was able to quarantine together in New York during lockdown shortly after. But it wasn't July 11, that rumors that the couple were engaged started to circulate.</p><p>They officially announced they were getting married (again via Instagram), after just nine months of dating, that same day, with a picture of them on a gorgeous day, kissing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria Beckham Is Proud Of Her Son Joining The Protesters In Los Angeles</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Peltz, who was wearing a Victoria Beckham dress for the picture, commented, "you’ve made me the luckiest girl in the world. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life by your side. your love is the most precious gift. I love you so so much baby and thank you, harper, for this pic."</p><p>In Beckham's post, he revealed he actually proposed two weeks before the announcement, saying, "Two weeks ago I asked my soulmate to marry me and she said yes xx I am the luckiest man in the world. I promise to be the best husband and the best daddy one day.&nbsp; I love you baby xx."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After that, both of Beckham's parents went on social media to congratulate their son and future daughter-in-law. Beckham later posted the pictures of the moment&nbsp;he asked Peltz to marry him.</p><h2 id=there-s-already-pregnancy-rumors>There's Already Pregnancy Rumors</h2><p>Just two days ago Peltz posted a photo of the couple embracing and kissing&nbsp;which has sparked some speculation amongst fans. Peltz, again wearing a Victoria Beckham dress, captioned the photo with, "baby b," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which has made fans think she's pregnant.</a></p><p>Before the picture was posted, there were already rumors that they'd secretly eloped, but now the rumors are focused on whether or not Peltz hinted she's pregnant instead.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Has David Beckham Finally Grown Out Of His Bad Boy Ways Into A Family Man?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after the post dropped, fans were commenting, saying things like, "congrats on the pregnancy", "mum & dad! ", and "Does this mean you’re pregnant?" Some simply commented, "????"</p><p>Beckham has also recently posted a photo of Peltz which has gotten the same speculation. The black and white photo shows Peltz in a black baby doll dress, and fans think that because she's wearing something flowy, it must mean she's pregnant.</p><p>This time commenters were saying, "I think she is pregnant 🤰"; "Is she pregnant?"; "David and Victoria gonna be grandparents soon 😊😉"; and "David's gonna be a grandpa?"</p><p>Obviously, "baby b" is Beckham, but you never know with celebrities and their subliminal messaging. So far there's been no confirmation or denying&nbsp;of the claim.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All we know is that the couple is already following in daddy and mama Beckham's footsteps by marrying after shortly dating, but they might not be walking into their wedding towing a baby just yet.</p><p>Beckham and Peltz just know what they want. When you know, you know, right?</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria Beckham Shares A Rare, Full-Toothed Smile...
