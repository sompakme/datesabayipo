With years of bartending under their belts, <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> couple <a href=#><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a> shared all their best cocktail recipes in Fancy AF Cocktails: Drink Recipes from a Couple of Professional Drinkers, and they gave Us Weekly a margarita recipe perfect for Cinco de Mayo — or any day that ends with a tequila craving.</p><p>“Before you saw any Vanderpump Rules relationships unfold, we were both bartenders,” Sandoval, 38, and Madix, 36, write in the introduction to <a href=#>their book of Insta-worthy creations</a>, which was cowritten by <a href=#><strong>Danny Pellegrino</strong></a>. “We worked in some of the most popular bars in New York, Chicago, Miami, and Los Angeles. We served drinks to celebrities, socialites, housewives, cool people, and definitely a few assholes. When it comes to life and our emotions we may be lacking, but when it comes to alcohol, and drinking . . . we are professionals.”</p><p>The pair, who <a href=#>have been together</a> since 2014, told Us exclusively <a href=#>ahead of the Fancy AF release</a> that the ideas didn’t just come from their bar menus. “Some of these cocktails came from us being out late at night, after the bar closes,” Sandoval revealed. “Somebody’s [like], ‘Yeah, come back to my place.’ You go back to their place, and they have a bottle of vodka. They have no mixers. So we end up going through their cabinets, their fridge, and basically over the years we’ve almost learned how to make a cocktail pretty much out of anything.”</p><p>He added at the time, “That’s where this Desperate Bloody Mary comes into play. For instance, you fill up a water bottle to the first line, it’s exactly two ounces. The next line with water, another ounce. Three ketchup packets, two Cholula packets, little bit of Tabasco, and that is a damn good Bloody Mary.”</p><p>This marg recipe, however, is a bit more posh. “All the drinks have a trash-o-meter,” Madix explained to Us. “So you’ve got classy on one side, trashy on the other, and it’ll tell you exactly where the drink lies on that scale.”</p><p>The Cucumber Pomegranate Margarita is all the way on the classy side of the scale.</p><p>This refreshing libation almost looks too good to be served at home. “Cucumber and pomegranate go together beautifully,” Sandoval notes in the book. “You’ll often find them paired in a salad, but you can also combine them in drink form.”</p><p>Pro tip: Make sure you have a cocktail shaker and muddler handy! The pair prefer Boston-style cocktail shakers, which work best with a Hawthorne-style strainer.</p><p>“Generally, when we say to ‘shake’ the ingredients in cocktail shaker, you should shake to a count of ten. More will dilute the drink, and less won’t properly mix the ingredients,” the <a href=#>Pump Rules</a> duo writes.</p><p><strong>Cucumber Pomegranate Margarita</strong></p><p><strong>Ingredients for 1 serving:</strong></p><ul><li>10–15 pomegranate seeds (or use pomegranate juice)</li><li>1/4 oz cardamom syrup</li><li>2 oz blanco tequila</li><li>1 oz cucumber juice</li><li>3/4 oz lime juice</li><li>Cucumber slice, pomegranate seeds (for garnish)</li></ul><p><strong>Garnishes:</strong></p><ul><li>Cucumber slice, pomegranate seeds</li></ul><p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br>1. In a cocktail shaker, muddle the pomegranate seeds with the cardamom syrup. Fill the remainder of the cocktail shaker with ice. Add the tequila, cucumber juice and lime juice.
