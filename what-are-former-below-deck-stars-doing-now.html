The television show highlights the life of a crew of a yacht. From arguments between crew members to annoying guests, Below Deck has plenty of drama and fans cannot get enough. The show has several spinoffs on Bravo, including Below Deck Mediterranean and Below Deck Down Under. Due to the show’s structure, many crew members have cycled through over the course of its nine seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many crew members of the yacht were featured for numerous seasons, such as chef Ben Robinson and Chief Stewardess Kate Chastain. Others, however, were only featured on the show for one season despite fans loving watching them. Let’s get into what former Below Deck stars are up to now that they are not sailing with the yacht.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does The Cast Of Below Deck Use A Script?</a></span></p><h2 id=adrienne-gang-is-now-a-chef><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Adrienne Gang Is Now A Chef</span></h2><p>Adrienne Gang was a member of the original cast of Bravo’s Below Deck. She was the Chief Stewardess during the show’s first season, but she has not returned to the Below Deck family since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She is now married to chiropractor Andrew Danks. Gang also chose to pivot her career as a Stewardess, instead getting into cuisine. She is now a freelance chef, but she still stays close to the sea.</p><p>Gang works as a chef for various yachts in Florida, which is where she resides. Fans love seeing the posts Gang makes on social media of her adorable dog. Gang even dresses her dog up in captain outfits!</p><h2 id=rhylee-gerber-is-enjoying-van-life><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Rhylee Gerber Is Enjoying Van Life</span></h2><p>Rhylee Gerber is a Deckhand from Alaska, and she was featured in season 6 of Below Deck as well as the second half of season 7. In between her stints on the Bravo show, Gerber worked on a dolphin and turtle boat in Hawaii.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since her time on the yacht, Gerber has returned to Alaska. Still craving the adventurous and mogul life she had during Below Deck, Gerber chose to pack up her belongings and go on a road trip. <a href=#>She is loving van life</a> and the chance to surround herself in nature.</p><h2 id=wes-o-rsquo-dell-is-a-captain><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Wes O’Dell Is A Captain</span></h2><p>Wes O’Dell was seen in the 9th season of Bravo’s hit show Below Deck. While on the show, O’Dell was a Deckhand. Now, however, O’Dell is the captain of his very own ship. He hired Below Deck Sailing Yacht alum Gabriela Barragan as his First Mate and the two are now dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barragan told the Gangplank Report podcast in April 2022 how O’Dell finally asked her own. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It has like a little horseshoe on it</a>—or like a hook. And if it’s facint outward, it means you’re open. And if it’s facing the other way, it means you’re taken,” she said in reference to the bracelet O’Dell gave her. “He put it on me with the hoseshoe, meaning closed. And I looked at him like, ‘Oh!’ And he’s like, ‘Yeah.’ I was like, ‘Awww, that’s so cute.’”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Below Deck Crew Members Were Fired, Here’s Why</a></span></p><h2 id=ashton-pienaar-after-his-near-death-experience><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ashton Pienaar After His Near-Death Experience</span></h2><p>Fans of Bravo’s Below Deck were terrified in season 6 when Ashton Pienaar’s safety was compromised. He was caught in a tow line and dragged into the water before a cameraman was able to save him. Pienaar did not let fear stop him, though, and he returned in season 7 as a Bosun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, Pienaar works as a fitness coach with his company AP Elite. He is also engaged to Sarah McAlpine Cooper. He proposed in an airport—in the exact same spot where they first met!</p><h2 id=kelley-johnson-has-a-youtube-channel><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kelley Johnson Has A YouTube Channel</span></h2><p>Kelley Johnson was in two seasons of Below Deck as an Engineer and a Bosun. He worked on the same yacht as his sister Amy Johnson. Now he has a very different career path. Johnson has a passion for photography, which he shares on social media. He actually was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the photographer for his sister’s wedding</a>.</p><p>Johnson is also a former member of the military. He hopes to spread his knowledge about what it is like for veterans transitioning back into the “civilian world.” Johnson has a YouTube channel where he talks about anxiety, stress, and the difficulties of getting back to regular life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ben-robinson-focuses-on-catering><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ben Robinson Focuses On Catering</span></h2><p>Ben Robinson is a former Chef on Bravo’s Below Deck. He was the original Chef of the show, and remained on Below Deck until after the 4th season. Robinson took a long hiatus from all things Below Deck, but since 2016 he has appeared in a handful of episodes of the spinoff show Below Deck Mediterranean.</p><p>Primarily, <a href=#>Robinson is focused on his catering business</a>. He is a certified health coach for weight loss, addiction prevention, and cancer. While fans miss seeing his personality on Below Deck, they are glad he is continuing to follow his passion for food.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Does The ‘Below Deck’ Cast Earn?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emily-warburton-adams-runs-a-nutritional-company><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Emily Warburton-Adams Runs A Nutritional Company</span></h2><p>While Emily Warburton-Adams was only featured in season 4 of Below Deck, she certainly made an impression on viewers. This was mostly due to her romance with Chef Ben Robinson during their time on the yacht. They lived together for a while in Florida after filming, but have since called it quits. <a href=#>They are not the only couple to have met on Below Deck or its spinoffs</a>.</p><p>After the split, Warburton-Adams returned to her hometown London. With her mother, she founded a nutritional catering company. Warburton-Adams is currently running POWFood in London.</p><h2 id=kate-chastain-is-enjoying-her-free-time><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kate Chastain Is Enjoying Her Free Time</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is hard for fans to believe that Chief Stewardess Kate Chastain would ever step away from yachting, but she did just that after being on Below Deck for six seasons. She felt it was time to get her footing on solid land and work towards being financially independent.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I just feel like I’m 37 and a half</a>—and I don’t think a girl should be swearing a skort at 38,” she said of her decision to leave. Chastain is now enjoying the peace and quiet in Florida. She spent the majority of the pandemic there with her dog Halo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYq6zsYyfpqullad6o7HLqK5mnJWYuG6%2F05qprGWUpLavs4ynprBn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-bronte-garden-hotel-harare-zimbabwe.html><span>←</span><span>The Bronte Garden Hotel, Harare, Zimbabwe</span></a>
