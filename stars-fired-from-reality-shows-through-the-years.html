Although drama makes for good reality TV, many stars have crossed a line and <a href=#>their actions have real consequences</a>.</p><p>In June 2020, following the <a href=#>murder of <strong>George Floyd</strong> </a>while in police custody, global protests began and <a href=#>thousands marched in support</a> of the <a href=#>Black Lives Matter movement</a>.</p><p>With that, many networks began looking at what their stars were posting on social media and were not happy with what they found. In a huge move by Bravo, the network announced in June 2020 that <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> stars <a href=#><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a>, <strong>Max Boyens</strong> and <strong>Brett Caprioni</strong> were all <a href=#>fired from the show</a> amid racially charged comments made in the past.</p><p>Schroeder and Doute subsequently apologized after their former costar <strong>Faith Stowers</strong> claimed that the women had falsely reported her to the police in 2018 for a crime she did not commit.</p><p>“Racially insensitive comments from my past have resurfaced,” the Next Level Basic author wrote via Instagram at the time. “It is important that I continue to take accountability for what I have said and done, while pushing myself to do better. I have grown significantly from the person I was then, and I am still filled with remorse and regret for the hurt I caused. I am grateful for the people in my life that continue to check me and push me to evolve into a more educated person.”</p><p>MTV also made a huge move during the movement, revealing that they would <a href=#>no longer be working with <strong>Dee Nguyen</strong></a>, who was participating on the current season of <a href=#>The Challenge</a>, after she made offensive tweets.</p><p>“As a result of Dee Nguyen’s offensive comments on the Black Lives Matter movement, we have severed ties with her,” the competition series announced via Twitter at the time. “Out of respect for our Challengers, we’ll air our season as planned. We strongly condemn systemic racism and stand with those raising their voices against injustice.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Challenge account also shared a link to multiple “anti-racism resources” for those who want to help. “We stand united against racism and urge you to join us in taking action to end racism, discrimination, and systemic violence,” the social media account added.</p><p>MTV also has also axed multiple cast members of the <a href=#>Teen Mom</a> franchise over the years, including <a href=#><strong>David Eason</strong></a>, after he made offensive comments via social media.</p><p>Although many fired stars have apologized for their actions after the fact, sometimes it’s too late.
