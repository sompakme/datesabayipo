But all eyes were on Kim’s expensive purse.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian Had Good Reason For Moving Tristan Thompson Into Her Million-Dollar Mansion</a></span></p><p>Photos showed her carrying a purse that closely <a href=#>resembles the matte white Diamond Himalaya Niloticus crocodile Birkin 30</a>, which sold in 2014 for a whopping $300,168, making it the most expensive purse to ever be auctioned off.</p><p>Kim paired the designer purse with a figure-hugging white tank top and white and grey motocross pants, which complimented the neutral color of her Birkin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's unclear exactly how much Kim’s model cost, but Birkins tend to range between $150,000 to $600,000, depending on the condition and rarity of the piece.</p><p>This is hardly the first time <a href=#>Kim has made headlines for wearing an ultra-expensive bag</a>. In 2014, her then-husband Kanye West gifted her a Birkin bag featuring a hand-painted design by George Condo. Kim used the hashtag #ChristmasPresentFromYeezy when posting about the bag to her Instagram. Estimates say it’s worth at least $40,000.</p><p>On a separate occasion, Kanye surprised Kim with a Birkin bag that was hand-painted by their eldest child, daughter North, when she was only a toddler. The Birkin alone retails for $20,000.</p><p>Kim has also been spotted in a metal Dior saddle bag, <a href=#>which carries a price tag of $35,000</a>. The Dior purse is so expensive largely because of its exclusively – only 10 of the bags were ever produced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the expensive bags Kim has in her collection, it’s likely that all of her purses combined cost a small fortune, especially considering she has multiple Birkin bags to her name, the priciest purses on the market.</p><p>Even though Kim wasn’t afraid to tote around her $300,000 Birkin earlier this month, the SKIMS founder has admitted to being more cautious about flaunting her wealth following the robbery she endued in Paris in 2016.</p><p>“No expensive items ever come to my home. I have it all taken from security before I even enter my home,” she said in a <a href=#>2021 episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians</a>.</p><p>“I can't sleep if I have jewelry in my safe, or money, or anything at my house. I just don't live my life like that,” Kim added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Margot Robbie Paid Off Her Mom’s Mortgage With First Big Acting Paycheck</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Geo TV</a>, <a href=#>Glamour</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8qipGajkaexor%2FHopinZZOWwLaty6WwZq%2Bfp7JurYxsZ2loYGV6o7XRpKCnZZKWtG7AzmaYZqufmLCmvoygmKadXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-owens-net-worth-how-much-is-kevin-owens-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Owens Net Worth How Much is Kevin Owens Worth?</span></a>
