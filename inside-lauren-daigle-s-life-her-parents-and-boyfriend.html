Daigle’s third album,&nbsp;Look Up Child,&nbsp;became the highest-charting Christian album by a woman in over two decades after it debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 chart.</p><p>Daigle has received two Grammy awards, five Billboard Music Awards, and seven GMA Dove Awards. It’s quite an impressive feat by the 29-year-old, considering that she released her debut album just over five years ago.</p><p>This piece will look at Lauren’s parents and her secretive love life.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Lauren’s mom described Daigle as the house’s ‘music box’ as she never stopped singing">Lauren’s mom described Daigle as the house’s ‘music box’ as she never stopped singing</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Lauren has been very secretive about her dating life, and is yet to be linked with anyone">Lauren has been very secretive about her dating life, and is yet to be linked with anyone</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=laurens-mom-described-daigle-as-the-houses-%e2%80%98music-box-as-she-never-stopped-singing></span>Lauren’s mom described Daigle as the house’s ‘music box’ as she never stopped singing<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lauren Daigle was born on 9th September 1991 in Lake Charles, Louisiana, to Laura and Mark Daigle. She grew up alongside a sister, Madison, and a brother, Brandon.</p><p>Laura noticed her daughter’s love for singing early on and once described her as the house’s ‘music box.’ Lauren’s parents and family offered their support when she decided to pursue music professionally. After listening to a preview of Look Up Child, Lauren’s grandfather told her that the album would make her a superstar. Lauren told The Advocate:</p><p>“Before the record came out, I played it for my whole family in the studio. They got the first listen. My grandfather looked up at me afterward and pulled me aside and spoke to me into my ear. He said, ‘This one’s gonna get big. Get ready. I just know this one’s gonna be different. I can feel it.’”</p><p>Mark and Laura can’t help but marvel at the impact their daughter has on people. Laura told The Advocate that her daughter’s success overwhelms her sometimes. “Her career is a wonderful thing,” Mark added. “What I’m most happy with is the stories we hear, in every part of the country, about how Lauren’s music has changed their lives.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lauren-has-been-very-secretive-about-her-dating-life-and-is-yet-to-be-linked-with-anyone></span>Lauren has been very secretive about her dating life, and is yet to be linked with anyone<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At the moment, Lauren’s focus seems to be her career and not her love life. She is yet to reveal any detail about her dating life, but in early 2019, she teased that she would reveal the identity of her partner.</p><p>However, it turned out to be an April Fool’s prank as the alleged boyfriend turned out to be Mr. Potato Head from Toy Story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGeqLalsYylmK6qlaN6pa3IoKOeq12htqexjKGcq2Wglr%2BmutOsZJqmlGKvsMXFq6CeppRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cat-amazing-shark-tank-founder-net-worth-and-investment.html><span>←</span><span>Cat Amazing Shark Tank Founder, Net Worth and Investment</span></a>
