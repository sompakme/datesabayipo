"At only 28 years of age, he is one of a handful of defining artists of the streaming era that has revitalized the entire music industry."</p><p>Justin’s manager, Scooter Braun, also confirmed that the deal was sealed, and that his client is happy with the outcome. "Justin is truly a once-in-a-generation artist and that is reflected and acknowledged by the magnitude of this deal," Scooter said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added, "For 15 years I have been grateful to witness this journey and today I am happy for all those involved. Justin's greatness is just beginning.”</p><p>Justin was rumored to be in negotiations last month, with reports saying this was bound to be the <a href=#>biggest acquisition in Hipgnosis’ history</a>. Prior to the deal, Justin had a cool net worth of $285 million. But thanks to the big pay day, his fortune will nearly double in value.</p><p>This isn’t the only music catalog Hipgnosis recently purchased, though it may be the most expensive. In 2021, they bought the rights to <a href=#>Justin Timberlake’s work for $100 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Justin Timberlake is not only one of the most influential artists of the last 20 years, but he’s also one of the greatest songwriters of all time,” Merck Mercuriadis said at the time.</p><p>“His hit songs including Cry Me a River, Rock Your Body, SexyBack, My Love, What Goes Around… Comes Around, Suit & Tie, Mirrors and Can’t Stop the Feeling are amongst the most iconic of the period,” the music executive continued.</p><p>An increasing number of musicians have begun selling their musical catalogs for huge pay days. At the end of 2022, <a href=#>Iggy Azalea sold hers for an undisclosed amount</a>, though it was reportedly an eight-figure deal.</p><p>One of the biggest acquisitions ever made was when Bruce Springsteen <a href=#>sold his publishing rights in 2021 for a whopping $500 million</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Brad Pitt Is Trying To Quietly Sell His $40 Million Mansion</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3tr%2FToqVmmpmar6a%2BjKycpaSjYr%2Bqs8etqmasn2J%2Fen2MrKann6Nis7C%2BjGtnaWWdnrmttc6nZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hussein-ammar-player-profile.html><span>←</span><span>Hussein Ammar - Player profile</span></a>
