Rogan's fans watch his videos with no filter in mind and frequently voice their issues with particular episodes or production issues. This time around, they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blame Spotify for </a>not releasing full video episodes on Rogan's YouTube channel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=full-episodes-v-clips>Full Episodes V. Clips</h2><p>Rogan posted a clip from his interview with comedian Michael Kosta. His full podcast episodes usually gain over a million views in a short amount of time. This twelve-minute clip has now nearly reached a quarter of a million views, but fans are upset with the video's format.</p><p>One frequent podcast listener wrote, "It’s sad. I literally ONLY watch the clips now," and another agreed, "The sad part is Spotify doesn’t have podcasts in some countries, thus there is no way for me to watch the JRE anymore."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Rogan Praises Netflix’s ‘The Queen’s Gambit’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Others noted the fact t<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hat Rogan's fanbase </a>loved their ability to comment and discuss full episodes. That was part of his pull, the unscripted honesty. While the music-focused platform is improving its accessibility, listeners should not have to find topsy turvy ways on the web to make Spotify readily available.</p><h2 id=changes-for-the-better>Changes For The Better?</h2><p>Episode&nbsp;#1567 featuring Donnell Rawlings and Dave Chappelle was the last full episode posted on the podcast's YouTube. That's from about a month ago. Since then, a majority of the clips that are cut specifically for YouTube are only around five minutes long. Once in a while, subscribers are graced with a fifteen-minute video.</p><p>This, however, is&nbsp;a drastic change compared to a three-hour episode <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that allows fans to</a> become an active part of the "experience."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Rogan Got A Special Mike Tyson Gift From Sports Illustrated</a></span></p><p>Fans are also wary of Spotify's reasoning behind the new routine. They want to improve viewership on their app considering the multi-million dollar deal they made with Rogan.</p><p>Does online traction require diluting&nbsp;the grounded ambiance Rogan's nurtured with the podcast?</p><p>Another fan clarified that this shift was inevitable and was a part of the Spotify transition, "Joe Rogan talked at the very beginning of the spotify deal that he would still have his JRE Clips page but all full interviews will be posted full on spotify and then their clips page a couple days later. It was all apart of the deal."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Rogan Believes Aliens Are Coming Soon</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ1dp7yorc1mnLGolae2prrCnmSfmZ6oeqK%2BxGasqauVqXq1tMCtZJ%2BtnKF6przIrKadnaNirrOxza1kqKZdrry2wNSbnGaZnq66sL7EaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-holland-freight-going-out-of-business.html><span>←</span><span>Is Holland Freight Going out of Business?</span></a>
