Narvel Blackstock, my manager and husband at the time — we got a divorce, and the shocker of it all was, there were four people who were taking care of all my business," she says of the experience. (PEOPLE has an exclusive first listen.) "I had my production manager who left, I had my CEO who left, my manager and husband, and my father had died. So four men who were rock and pillars of my world were gone," she said.</p><p>Because of this massive change, Reba was forced to evaluate her finances, and figure out what to do.</p><p>"I started taking over signing the checks and then I started realizing how much water cost, and the electric bill, and all the things that was going on in my life. I made the money, I brought it home.

I had to say, 'OK big boy, I can't handle this. This is way over my pay grade — I don't know what to do.' And I would wait, and He would guide me. And so without my faith, I have no idea where I would be or my career would be, at this time today," she said.</p><p>The selfless star even had some advice for others going through their own personal valleys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/reba-show.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Reba Made Extra Profits Off Syndication, But A Former Showrunner Claims The Revenue Was Split Unfairly</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>A former Reba employee was seeking over $1 million in damages from her time on the show behind the scenes.</span><p>"If someone walked up to me and said, 'Reba, I'm going through a situation like you did — what's your advice?'
