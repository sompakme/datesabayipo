It’s to make you proud.” She later added, “People ask about it because they’re curious, or they may not understand. How will they ever get understand if I don’t talk about it? I can inform your curiosity, as opposed to everyone being in the dark and just sort of <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234799748>creating their own narrative </a>about it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234623818>Vacation Friends</a> star also opened up about her faith and sex with Hailey Bieber.
