But did you know that Chris is also good friends with fellow R&B singer Tory Lanez?</p><p>While their friendship maybe isn’t publicized <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as often as Chris’ ties with Tyga</a>, for example, Tory and the Virginia native have been close for as long as fans can remember — but in recent years, the two have become rather inseparable from one another, whether it’s to create music, play basketball, or hit the club together. Here’s all you need to know.</p><h2 id=chris-brown-s-friendship-with-tory-lanez>Chris Brown’s Friendship With Tory Lanez</h2><p>It’s not clear how long the two have been friends, but fans have spotted the two hanging out since 2015, and since then, they have collaborated on a string of hit songs together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of their most popular collabs include “Drifting,” Tell Me How You Feel,” “Lurkin,” “The Take,” and most recently “Feels,” which was released in February 2021.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Brown Fans Joke He’s Somewhere ‘Moonwalking’ After Karrueche’s ‘Love Split’</a></span></p><p>With all these songs, it’s clear that Chris and Tory certainly know how to catch a vibe in the recording studio to pen countless R&B hits together. People probably wouldn’t even be surprised if Chris ended up announcing that he’s working on a joint album with Tory, similar to how he did with Tyga for their 2015 record, Fan of a Fan.</p><p>Aside from music, however, Chris also seems to be quite the loyal friend, after putting people in their place for bringing up his name following Megan Thee Stallion’s claims that Tory had “shot me in both feet,” which the 28-year-old has strongly denied.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some social media critics were quick to draw comparisons between Tory and Megan's case to Chris and Rihanna’s assault incidence, so aside from standing up for his friend, the Grammy winner <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">also wanted to clear his name in the drama</a> that was erupting with his name being dragged up in the mix of things.</p><p>In August 2021, he took to his Instagram Story and vented, “LEAVE MY FU**ING NAME OUT OF SOMEONE ELSES SITUATION. YALL NOT FINNA INVOLVE ME IN THIS F**K A** SH**! Pu**y BI**H, YALL MAKE ME SICK WIT THIS LAME SH*T.. SUCK MY D**K OR SIT ON IT…”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is Why Fans Believe Cardi B And Megan Thee Stallion Are Not Really Friends</a></span></p><p>That’s one way to make a statement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Needless to say, when it comes to Hollywood friendships, Chris knows a thing or two about befriending genuine people who he can see himself share close ties with for a lifetime. He’s practically known Teyana Taylor since she was 16 years old. She’s 30 now.</p><p>One friendship that turned rocky for Chris was his bond with Drake, which came to an end after the Canadian rapper began sharing an on-again, off-again romance with his ex-girlfriend Rihanna.</p><p>Back in 2012, the two got into a bloody nightclub brawl over the “Umbrella” superstar, before both stars continued to diss each other in songs and on social media.</p><p>By 2015, however, the pair appeared to have ended their feud when they were spotted in the recording studio together.</p><p>In a 2019 interview with Rap Radar, the “Hotline Bling” chart-topper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shed light on his former rivalry with Chris</a> and why it was important for him to call a truce.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrity Dads & What They’ve Said About Fatherhood</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I actually had a moment of hesitation before because I didn’t want her to ever feel disrespected by me linking up with him but I also know how many nights she knows that me and him have both been consumed by this issue,” he shared.</p><p>“I think she’s a good person with a good heart that would rather see us put that issue to bed than continue childish s–t that can end up in a serious situation, so I decided to go ahead with it.”</p><p>Chris and Drake have also proven themselves to be a force to be reckoned with when it comes to their collaborations, which include “Not You Too,” and their most popular song “No Guidance,” which peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went on to sell over 8 million copies in the U.S.</p><p>The two are also frequently spotted at industry event together where posing for photos never seem to be an issue for either one of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While we don’t know how close they are behind the scenes, it’s fair to say that Chris and Drake have also formed a close bond since ending their feud over Rihanna.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s What Drake’s Exes Have Said About Him</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLmwv8RmmKudXam8s8WMpZinnapirq%2BwjJyfq6GjYq%2Bzu9anZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlamagne-tha-god-calls-lauryn-hill-entitled-in-his-donkey-of-the-day-rant.html><span>←</span><span>Charlamagne Tha God Calls Lauryn Hill &amp;quot;Entitled&amp;quot; In His Donkey of The Day Rant</span></a>
