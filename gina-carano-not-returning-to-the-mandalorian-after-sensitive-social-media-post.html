"Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable."</p><p>Carano's social media activity has come under fire in recent times and, prior to the statement, the hashtag #FireGinaCarano was trending on the back of a post that compared her experience when it comes to being politically conservative to the struggles of Jewish people during the Holocaust.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors…even by children. Because history is edited, most people today don’t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views,” she wrote.</p><p>The TikTok post was later deleted but was shared multiple times before being taken down.</p><p>The martial artist had also been criticized for tweets last year including one in November in which she criticized the use of masks and another siding with the claims of voter fraud in the U.S presidential elections.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to that, Carano changed her Twitter bio to "boop/bop/beep" in an act that was taken to be a mockery of people who include their preferred pronouns on their accounts. "They're mad cuz I won't put pronouns in my bio to show my support for trans lives," she told a fan after being asked why she was under fire because of the change. "After months of harassing me in every way. I decided to put 3 VERY controversial words in my bio.. beep/bop/boop I'm not against trans lives at all. They need to find less abusive representation."</p><p>She later changed stances after claims that the sister of her co-star Pedro Pascal, who came out as transgender, helped her understand why people were adding pronouns to their bios.</p><p>"I didn't know before but I do now," she said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>. I won't be putting them in my bio but good for all you who choose to. I stand against bullying, especially the most vulnerable & freedom to choose."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!</a></p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="CAA Drops Shia LaBeouf Following Sexual Battery Claims" href=#>CAA Drops Shia LaBeouf Following Sexual Battery Claims</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZ2cmsOqv8iopWifmaOubq%2FAq5inp12jvLV50Z6rrqqenruoedOhnGalkaOxorjOq6Capl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elijah-irvin-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Elijah Irvin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
