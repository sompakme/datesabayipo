Nick, as the drummer, was the only member of the crew who remained a part of the group from its inception until it disbanded. <a href=#>He has amassed a $180 million net worth</a> through the successful music run. Being an avid collector has spent a lot of his fortune buying vintage cars over the years. A fan of mechanical things, he has loved tuning and restoring his vintage <a href=#>cars worth millions today</a>.</p><p>From rare-edition Ferrari cars that cost an arm and a leg in the market to race-worthy first iteration McLaren F1, each car owned by Nick Mason has a different story to tell from a different time and age. Let’s take a look at the Pink Floyd drummer’s beautiful car collection.</p><h2 id=1962-ferrari-250-gto-42-million>1962 Ferrari 250 GTO ($42 million)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among Mason's fleet of Ferrari cars, the most famous is the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO. Nick purchased the car in the seventies for $42,000, and the same car is now worth $42 million. As only 36 units of the 250 GTO got built, it is an extremely rare car in the market, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>. As the car was hand-built, no two 250 GTOs look the same. Mason has driven its powerful V12 engine on many occasions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Things You Didn't Know About Pink Floyd</a></span></p><h2 id=1957-maserati-250f-2-million>1957 Maserati 250F ($2 million)</h2><p>In 2009, <a href=#>the Maserati 250F got voted the world’s greatest racing car</a>. In the 1950s, the car got raced by legendary drivers Stirling Moss and Juan Manuel Fangio. For the 1957 iteration, the car got equipped with a 2.5-liter V12 engine instead of the in-line six for maximum speed on the racecourse. It provided an output of a whopping 220-270 HP.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1955-jaguar-d-type-5-7-million>1955 Jaguar D-Type ($5.7 million)</h2><p>Launched in 1954, the Jaguar D-Type won three straight 24 Hours of Le Man's titles between 1955 and 1957. The D-Type got strapped with a 3.4-liter XK in-line six-cylinder engine that makes 245 HP. Jaguar only manufactured 17 race cars, 11 with a long nose in addition to 54 race cars for the public.</p><h2 id=1927-bugatti-type-35b-605-000>1927 Bugatti Type 35B ($605,000)</h2><p>One of the most popular racing cars, the Bugatti Type 35, was only produced between 1924 and 1930. As a forefather of the Chiron, it had a 2.0-liter straight-eight engine under the hood. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Motor Trend</a>, the 35B was a power upgrade and came with a 2.3-liter in-line eight that offered a top speed of 134 MPH.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1953-ferrari-250-mm-13-million>1953 Ferrari 250 MM ($13 million)</h2><p>One of the most illustrious cars ever made, only thirty-one 250 MM <a href=#>models were made by Ferrari</a>. The midcentury 250 MM raced in a border-to-border sedan rally called Carrera Panamericana. The 1953 iteration won many additional races, making it a favorite amongst the Ferrari clientele. After the car retired from racing, it went through three restorations before Mason purchased it in 2011.</p><h2 id=1901-panhard-5-litre-379-000>1901 Panhard 5-litre ($379,000)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Panhard vehicles are rarely seen on the streets today, they had a strong presence in the market during the start of the 20th century. The oldest car in Mason’s collection, the Panhard was a vintage beauty with a 5-liter engine that squeezed 24 HP. It could ferry four to five people at once and race a 54-mile race at a time.</p><h2 id=1996-mclaren-f1-gtr-10-million>1996 McLaren F1 GTR ($10 million)</h2><p>In 1992, McLaren introduced the F1 and took the supercar market by storm. It was the first car made from carbon fiber with a center-mounted driver’s seat. It was the fastest production car with unique features and innovations. It got equipped with a 6-speed V12 engine that gave an output of 600 horses and pranced to 60 MPH in merely 3 seconds, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Speed</a>.</p><h2 id=1935-aston-martin-ulster-3-million>1935 Aston Martin Ulster ($3 million)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The model that made Aston Martin famous </a>before the second World War, the Ulster, was a competition car with a rugged chassis, and the 1.5-liter car tackled all the critical races in the world, from the Mile Miglia to the Le Mans. It has served as a part of many long-distance rallies over the years.</p><h2 id=1959-maserati-tipo-61-birdcage-3-52-million>1959 Maserati Tipo 61 Birdcage ($3.52 million)</h2><p>Tipo 61, nicknamed Birdcage, was introduced to replace the series of roofless cars designed by Maserati. The Birdcage was Maserati's first front-mounted engine car with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The car set a speed record for the fastest car under the 3.0-liter engine category at the 24 Hours Le Mans.</p><h2 id=1970-ferrari-512-s-3-million>1970 Ferrari 512 S ($3 million)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Ferrari sold 50 percent of its ownership to Fiat, Enzo Ferrari began a new project for the 5-liter class. The company built 25 models within three months to approve the car. The 512 S got equipped with a four-cylinder V12 engine that delivered a whopping 550 HP with a top speed of 211 MPH, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ferrari</a>.</p><p>While it is said that Nick Mason’s collection once had 40 cars in his collection, the drummer has kept the location of his other automobiles a secret from everyone. As one of the biggest celebrity petrolheads, his collection has made him a part of several vintage car associations, and the rare cars have been borrowed and used by people for various occasions.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Becoming A Beatle: Here's How Ringo Starr Became The Richest Drummer In The World</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Motor Trend</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Speed</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ferrari</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8inqqKclWK9qrrKZp2lp6mZeqW%2B1Kaknqpdo7akt4ymmKynnqh6pK3RZpqopJyasLW1zqdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-close-are-tory-lanez-and-chris-brown.html><span>←</span><span>How Close Are Tory Lanez And Chris Brown?</span></a>
