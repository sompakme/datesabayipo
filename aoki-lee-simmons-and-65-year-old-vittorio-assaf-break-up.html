He was 18 years her senior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-73280323-e1712695931392.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In regards to Aoki and Vittorio, who have a 44-year age gap, another source also told <a rel=nofollow href=#>Page Six</a>, “It’s 100% done. They’re absolutely not dating.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On Friday (April 5), the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=641674>Harvard graduate</a> was spotted kissing the Serafina restauranteur while vacationing in St. Barth’s. Later, Aoki appeared on Instagram Live with Vittorio off-camera as they explored the island and she pointed out her favorite shops including Cartier and Bulgari.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She repeatedly called him her “boyfriend” as he slipped up and revealed that Mary J. Blige wanted to be “<a href=#>his partner</a>” at some point. Aoki quickly told him to hush and he didn’t expound further.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Aoki is the youngest daughter of Kimora and Russell. The latter professed his “<a href=#>unconditional love</a>” for his daughter amid news of her new relationship. Kimora didn’t make a formal statement regarding Aoki’s love life, but did celebrate her recent campaign with BCBG.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a8rLWMpZyeZaOeuq67zaxkm6epm7%2Bqsc2dZK%2BhpKm8s7XOZpisq5GbeqO%2BxJqiZq2gYn5zf5NxbXFwZmh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-netflix-originals-nobody-likes-and-10-everyone-loves.html><span>←</span><span>10 Netflix Originals Nobody Likes (And 10 Everyone Loves)</span></a>
