Tragically, their whirlwind romance ultimately proved remarkably fickle against the scores of complications their marriage would face. Following <a href=#>a tumultuous two-year marriage</a>, the couple inevitably filed for divorce. Here’s why, despite their divorce, Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee’s lives will remain inextricably linked.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Pamela Anderson Went From Earning $6.6 Million A Year To Being Flat Out Broke</a></span></p><h2 id=when-did-pamela-anderson-and-tommy-lee-start-dating><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>When Did Pamela Anderson And Tommy Lee Start Dating?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pam-and-tommy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee’s paths first intertwined at a club on New Year’s Eve in 1994.

"Pamela and I were fighting all the time," Lee wrote in Mötley Crüe's autobiography. "Trying to raise our children, continue the careers that consumed us, make a new relationship work and deal with the non-stop barrage of bulls--- in the press, was more of a challenge than we ever could have expected."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Most Controversial Moments Of Pamela Anderson’s Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tommy-lee-and-pamela-anderson-reconciled-and-broke-up-multiple-times><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Tommy Lee And Pamela Anderson Reconciled And Broke Up Multiple Times</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/anderson-and-lee.jpg><p>Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson were spotted getting rather cozy with each other on multiple occasions after their divorce.
