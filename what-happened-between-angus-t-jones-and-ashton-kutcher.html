Jones really had it all as a child star, <a href=#>with a reported net worth of $20 million and stunning home</a>. However, his time came up after a viral rant, <a href=#>one that caused his exit from the show</a> and in truth, <a href=#>his career never resumed since then.</a><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Angus T. Jones Might Be Off The Map But He's Still Making Millions</a></span>In the following, we'll take a look at the reactions behind the scenes amongst his peers. The likes of Jon Cryer and Ashton Kutcher were worried and as it turns out, Kutcher might've wanted his co-star gone from Two and a Half Men.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angus-t-jones-went-on-a-viral-rant-prior-to-his-two-and-a-half-men-exit>Angus T. Jones Went On A Viral Rant Prior To His Two And A Half Men Exit</h2><p>It was a sudden departure nobody could have expected. Angus T. Jones was among the elite child stars, banking $350,000 during his prime, the equivalent to $9 million and $10 million per season. Despite the huge pay and large net worth, Angus T. Jones went on a rant, which ended his time on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Here's Why Viewers Were Upset When Angus T. Jones Dissed 'Two And A Half Men'</a></span></p><p>At the time, <a href=#>Angus T. Jones was into his faith</a> and in turn, he disagreed with the content getting put out by Two and a Half Men.</p><p>"There’s no playing around when it comes to eternity... People will see us and be like, ‘I can be a Christian and be on a show like Two and a Half Men.’ You can’t. You cannot be a true God-fearing person and be on a television show like that. I know I can’t.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He furthered his statement telling fans to avoid the show entirely. “If you watch Two and a Half Men, please stop watching Two and a Half Men. I’m on Two and a Half Men and I don’t want to be on it. Please stop watching it and filling your head with filth. People say it’s just entertainment. Do some research on the effects of television and your brain, and I promise you, you’ll have a decision to make when it comes to television, especially with what you watch.”</p><p>The reaction was pure shock not only from the fans but his peers as well. This included Ashton Kutcher, who was worried about his co-star.</p><h2 id=ashton-kutcher-worried-about-angus-t-jones-during-his-time-on-the-sitcom-and-might-ve-wanted-him-gone>Ashton Kutcher Worried About Angus T. Jones During His Time On The Sitcom And Might've Wanted Him Gone</h2><p><a href=#>Jon Cryer has vivid memories of Angus T. Jones' meltdown behind the scenes</a>. According to Cryer at the time, it was as if the show was cursed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"'It is crazy. I have no explanation for it. You could say the show is cursed except the show has been cursed with being monumentally successful so it’s hard to call that a curse," Cryer said with Daily Mail.</p><p>"Angus’ one was so minor because I wasn’t actually worried that any actual harm would come to him and he’s already been back to work several times."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>What Has Angus T. Jones Been Up To Since 'Two And A Half Men'?</a></span></p><p>Ashton Kutcher on the other hand, was very worried about his colleague. Following the rant, it was Kutcher that approached Cryer with the details.</p><p>"When the latest one happened Ashton came up to me and he looked like he had seen a ghost and he was like, "Did you hear about Angus? And I was like, "He is ok?" He said, "sort of," and he showed me the video. It was one strange turn after another."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were also rumors floating around that Kutcher wanted the child star gone from the show after the viral moment.</p><p>Finally, following the ordeal, Angus T. Jones did admit he was wrong with his assessment.</p><h2 id=angus-t-jones-showed-regret-for-his-actions-against-two-and-a-half-men>Angus T. Jones Showed Regret For His Actions Against Two And A Half Men</h2><p>Kutcher and his peers were put at ease when Angus issued an apology. Without a doubt, it was must've been a nightmare for his PR team to handle. <a href=#>The child star wrote in his apology,</a> “I apologize if my remarks reflect me showing indifference to and disrespect of my colleagues and a lack of appreciation of the extraordinary opportunity of which I have been blessed."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Without qualification, I am grateful to and have the highest regard and respect for all of the wonderful people on Two and Half Men with whom I have worked and over the past 10 years who have become an extension of my family,” he added.</p><p>Jones stated that his way of thinking was "pretty doomsday" back then, but thankfully, things have changed for the better these days. Still, the child star has separated himself from Hollywood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmmZ6cwrR502ahqKaVqHqiusNmmKygpKS7brfUrZqhnaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ridley-asha-bateman-where-are-they-from-age-birthday.html><span>←</span><span>Ridley Asha Bateman Where Are They From?
