The Rumble is typically an event held in January, but Fightful Select also recently reported that WWE is actually targeting early February as a possible date for the PPV. (It’s worth noting that WWE has already confirmed its <a href=# rel=noopener>“Day 1” pay-per-view event in Atlanta</a>&nbsp;will take place on New Year’s Day, so there will still be a January event no matter when the Rumble takes place.) Additionally, <a href=# rel=noopener>Fightful</a> also reported St. Louis is considered to be a front-runner to host the Royal Rumble, but plans are not set in stone for the host city yet.</p><p>Owens took part in a 2018 interview and said that he’d signed a new five-year contract, which would have taken him through 2023. Fightful’s Sean Ross Sapp explained that&nbsp;WWE restructured multiple contracts before the pandemic, and the end date of Owens’ deal was affected. It’s unknown why this change was made, but Sapp once again clarified that the deals were renegotiated ahead of the pandemic, not at the start of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFua2xuYmK4psLIp2Sor5WjwG7D1p5knKeeqb%2Bir9NmnLGomaeytHnJmqWumaKuenR9jGtna2o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pressure-mounts-on-travis-kelce-to-propose-to-taylor-swift-as-her-eras-tour-set-changes.html><span>←</span><span>Pressure Mounts On Travis Kelce To Propose To Taylor Swift As Her Eras Tour Set Changes</span></a>
