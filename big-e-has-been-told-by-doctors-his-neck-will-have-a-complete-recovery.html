While The New Day member has been told that he’ll make a full recovery, he understands how lucky he is, as doctors had told him that this injury had caused “stroke, paralysis or death” to others.</p><p>“It’s very sobering to hear that,” Big E said. “… I think to be great at something like [pro wrestling] or at least to be competent, you can’t spend all your time worrying about possibly fatal injuries or breaking your neck. You have to go out there and be free and in the moment. I think a lot of us as performers don’t spend a lot of time thinking about that stuff. I never thought I would be.”</p><p>While most people would be extremely depressed over a situation like this, Big E doesn’t believe he’s in a dark period and thanks all of the people who have checked in on him and reached out since the injury took place.</p><p>“Honestly, it hasn’t been a dark period,” Big E said. “I’m so thankful for all the people who checked in on me and reached out, who have concerns. I’m not saying I’m perfect. I’m not saying every day is the greatest ever for me. But I really haven’t struggled with that type of stuff.”</p><p>SmackDown Superstar Ridge Holland is the wrestler who accidentally injured Big E with a poorly executed belly-to-belly suplex on the outside of the ring. Big E confirms he has no issue with Holland and that he’s reached out and checked in on him following the injury.</p><p>“I have no issue whatsoever with Ridge,” Big E said. “He’s reached out and said some very kind things. … What we do is dangerous, and there are inherent dangers. And to that degree, we all kind of know what we sign up for and it was unfortunate that it went down that way. But I’m not dead. I’m alive. I’m doing well.”</p><p>Following the release of the article, a member of the WWE Universe commented on how lucky Big E was to not die from this injury; The New Day member responded by telling them he believes he’s officially in his “bonus years.” Tweeting out:</p><p>“I refer to the rest of my life as ‘the bonus years.’ I’m playing with house money now! About to get that limb lengthening surgery and be the 6 foot king I always dreamed of,” <a href=#>Big E said in a tweet</a>.</p><p>What do you make of Big E’s comments? Are you relieved to see that he’s in such a good place mentally?
