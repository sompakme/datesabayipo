These stars have then been able to watch their family grow as they travelled the world and are now grandfathers at quite young ages. Many WWE Hall of Famers have been able to retire and then raise their own children to become some of the biggest stars of the past generation. These stars have then gone on to have their own children and now there are a number of WWE Hall of Famers and former World Champions who are grandfathers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are so many generations of wrestling&nbsp;families who have come through the company over the past few years that it seems that many of these stars were always destined to become grandfathers since they all have huge families. There are other stars like Ric Flair and Sika Anoa'i whose children are now performing on WWE TV, but they also have other children who have children of their own.</p><p>The following list of looks at just 15 current and former WWE superstars who are all grandparents.&nbsp;Some of them are quite young, which could be why many of the WWE Universe were unaware that their favourite stars were old enough to have children who have their own children. All of these stars have revealed that they are proud grandparents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brock-lesnar>Brock Lesnar</h2><p>Brock Lesnar is the reigning Universal Champion and one of the biggest draws in the wrestling business right now. He is also a former UFC Champion but decided to return to the WWE back in 2012. Outside of WWE Brock Lesnar has&nbsp;four children and a stepdaughter from his two relationships. He was once engaged to a woman called Nicole McClain before the&nbsp;two went their separate ways and Brock then met Sable when she returned to the WWE for the second time.</p><p>Brock has twins with Nicole called Luke and Mya as well as two sons with his current wife and former WWE Diva Sable called Duke and Turk. Sable has a daughter from her previous marriage called Mariah. It's through his stepdaughter that Brock is a grandfather since she recently revealed that she had given birth to a daughter. Brock is just 40 years old and the youngest grandfather on this entire list.</p><h2 id=vince-mcmahon>Vince McMahon</h2><p>Vincent Kennedy McMahon is the brains behind the WWE and the Chairman of the company, but even though Vince has thrown himself into his professional career over the past few years and has been rumoured to have had a number of&nbsp;illicit flings while working in WWE, his marriage has always remained in a good place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vince has been married to Linda McMahon ever since 1966 and together they have two children Shane and Stephanie. Both children are currently part of WWE programming with Shane being the commissioner of SmackDown Live and Stephanie the commissioner of Raw. Outside of the company both children also have families of their own, Stephanie is married to WWE COO Triple H and has three daughters while Shane is married to&nbsp;Marissa Mazzola and has three sons. Family dinners are definitely quite a large occasion for the McMahons nowadays.</p><h2 id=rikishi>Rikishi</h2><p>Rikishi is a former Intercontinental Champion and a WWE Hall of Famer. During his run in WWE he became well-known for his stink-face manoeuvre, which his two sons have attempted to adopt throughout their careers. Jimmy and Jey Usos have followed in their father's footsteps in recent years after their cousin Umaga helped them to land a tryout with WWE.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They have since become one of the best tag teams of the current era and are the reigning SmackDown Tag Team Champions. Both Jimmy and Jey are married and they both have children. Jimmy is married to fellow WWE star Naomi and has two children called Jayla and Jaidan while Jey is also married and has two sons. This means that Rikishi is the grandfather to their four children. Rikishi is just 52 years old but he has been a grandfather for a few years, which means that he reached the milestone before he was 50.</p><h2 id=sika-anoa-i>Sika Anoa'i</h2><p>Sika Anoa'i is probably better known now than he was when he was in the ring, but the former tag team champion was once one half of The Wild Samoans alongside his brother Afa. Wrestling has always been in Anoa'i blood, which is why his son Roman Reigns has grown up to become a WWE superstar as well. Sika has been seen supporting his son at some of his biggest events over the past few years as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Roman Reigns has been on WWE TV for the past five years and has become one of the biggest stars in the company currently. It seems that the former World Champion is able to balance his private and professional lives quite well, since he is the father of a daughter called Joelle and twin boys who were born a few years ago. It's obvious that Sika has his hands full with Roman's family while he's on the road.</p><h2 id=ken-shamrock>Ken Shamrock</h2><p>There is a reason why Ken Shamrock was once known as "The World's Most Dangerous Man." The former UFC star had such an impressive career,&nbsp;which, in turn, managed to push him into the wrestling business. Even though Shamrock's tenure was a relatively short one, it had some fantastic moments as he aligned himself with the corporation and became their muscle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Outside of the wrestling business, Shamrock has quite a healthy personal life since he has seven children from two marriages. Shamrock has four of his own children and three step-children. From these children, the former Champion also has ten grandchildren, which means that even though he's been retired for some time, he is definitely still&nbsp;keeping himself busy. Shamrock decided to walk away from the wrestling business after a stint in TNA back in 2004 and has since been spending time with his family, which has obviously continued to grow over the past few years.</p><h2 id=bob-orton-jr>Bob Orton Jr.</h2><p>Bob Orton is another WWE legend who, even though he is a WWE Hall of Famer, doesn't have a lot to show for his time as part of the biggest promotion in the world. Bob struggled to remain relevant and fought for every opportunity he was given in WWE, while his son Randy has been able to take to it like a duck to water and has become one of the biggest stars in the company over the past decade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As well as being a successful in-ring performer, Orton has also been married twice and has two daughters from these relationships: one called Alanna from his marriage to Samantha Speno and one called Brooklyn Rose from his current marriage to Kim Marie Kessler. Orton is also the stepfather of Kessler's three sons, which means that his father Bob has a lot of young children to be running after.</p><h2 id=mike-rotunda>Mike Rotunda</h2><p>Mike Rotunda was best-known in the wrestling business as Irwin R. Schyster (I.R.S.) throughout his career, but he is now best known as the father of current WWE stars Bray Wyatt and Bo Dallas. Rotunda had quite the career of his own in the late 80s and early 1990s before he raised his sons to follow in his footsteps.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though his son Bray's personal life has been made public knowledge over the past year, Wyatt is still a father to his two daughters called&nbsp;Cadyn and Kendyl, even though his divorce from his wife has recently been finalized and Wyatt is now in a relationship with ring announcer JoJo Offerman. Bo Dallas is married to former NXT star Sarah Backman but the couple doesn't yet have any children. Mike is only a grandfather to Bray's two daughters, who he is still able to see since the recent divorce.</p><h2 id=jim-ross>Jim Ross</h2><p>Jim Ross is the legendary commentator that the WWE Universe will most associate with some of the biggest matches in WWE history. Ross is also a WWE Hall of Famer and despite being on the road with WWE for a number of years, Ross was able to hold down a functional relationship for more than two decades and has two children from the marriage as well as two grandchildren.</p><p>Ross has made a number of appearances for WWE over the past few years, most recently as part of Raw 25 when the old team of Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler was brought back together for one night only. Ross's wife Jan passed away back in March 2017 when she was in a vehicle collision.&nbsp;She was put on life support but&nbsp;passed away two days later. Ross has been spending a lot more time with his family over the past year ever since the accident.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ric-flair>Ric Flair</h2><p>Ric Flair is a former 16-time World Champion and the only ever two-time WWE Hall of Famer. Flair is one of the biggest legends that the company has ever created and his&nbsp;youngest daughter&nbsp;Ashley has been able to continue that legacy as Charlotte on WWE TV.</p><p>Even though Flair's personal life has left him out of pocket a number of times since he's now been married and divorced four times, he has four children from these marriages. His son Reid passed away back in 2013, his daughter Charlotte then turned to the wrestling business to honour her brother and his eldest daughter Megan has since decided to create a family of her own and is the reason why Ric has become a grandfather. Ric also has an older son called David who also attempted to make it in the wrestling business but is best known for his time in WCW.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ted-dibiase>Ted DiBiase</h2><p>Ted DiBiase was better known as The Million Dollar Man throughout his time in WWE, before his son then made his way into the company and was known under the same name, but wasn't as successful with the Million Dollar gimmick. Ted DiBiase is a WWE Hall of Famer, but his son didn't quite live up to the reputation his father gained and has since left the company to pursue other career options.</p><p>Ted is now a father as well since his wife gave birth to their first son back in 2013 around the same time that DiBiase decided to retire from wrestling and pursue a career as part of a college textbook e-commerce website.&nbsp;Ted DiBiase Sr is a grandfather but he is also a WWE Hall of Famer and a legend in the eyes of many of the WWE Universe and current WWE roster.</p><h2 id=stone-cold-steve-austin>Stone Cold Steve Austin</h2><p>Stone Cold Steve Austin will always be known as the ruthless character that he once played on WWE TV and even though his marriage to former WWE star Debra ended in less than great circumstances, Austin's personal life is in much better shape than many stars who have been through the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Austin has been married four times and has two children from these relationships as well as a daughter that he adopted when he married his second wife. It is through Jade that Austin is a grandfather at the ripe old age of 53. Jade has a son and Austin is quite fond of the little boy, since he is the closest thing he has to a son, because Austin himself only has three daughters. One of his daughters called Cassidy lives with her mother in England while Stephanie, who is his other biological daughter, resides in Los Angeles.</p><h2 id=bret-hart>Bret Hart</h2><p>Bret Hart is seen by many wrestling fans as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time, but Bret is another star whose personal life has suffered throughout his stint in the spotlight. Bret has been married three times, with his first marriage to Julie giving him four children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Bret is now 60 years old, he has been a grandfather for the past eight years, since his eldest daughter Jade gave birth to his first granddaughter back in 2010 and his third child Alexandra gave birth to his first grandson back in 2015. Bret missed the 25th Anniversary of Raw because he had to see a hand specialist, but "the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be" is now settled in his personal life and has been married to Stephanie Washington since 2010. Washington is 33 years younger than Bret.</p><h2 id=jake-the-snake-roberts>Jake "The Snake" Roberts</h2><p>Jake "The Snake" Roberts is a WWE Hall of Famer and one of the most iconic stars in WWE history. Jake may have never been able to lift a WWE Championship during his lengthy stint in the biggest wrestling promotion in the world, but he is still seen as one of the most loved wrestlers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jake's struggles in his personal life have been well-documented over the past few years after he had issues with both&nbsp;substance abuse and alcohol addiction, but when he finally took his rightful place in the Hall of Fame back in 2014, he gave a passionate speech where he thanked all of his children for their support over the past few years, as well as revealing that he was a grandfather to around 10 grandchildren as well. Jake is reported to have eight children in total from his two marriages and his grandchild count still continues to go up.</p><h2 id=batista>Batista</h2><p>Batista is a former World Champion and was once one of the most popular WWE stars in the company before he decided to switch careers and is now a successful actor as well. Batista is just 49 years old and is in his third marriage, but despite his obvious issues in his personal life, Batista has two daughters called Keilani and Athena from his first wife Glenda, who he married in the early 1990s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Batista actually became a grandfather before he was 40 since his eldest daughter Keilani has two sons called&nbsp;Jacob and Aiden. Even though Batista is one of the most successful former wrestlers in history, given his current acting career, the former World Champion has had a number of struggles in his personal life with his two divorces and subsequent recent marriage, but he's still managed to remain close to his two daughters.</p><h2 id=kane>Kane</h2><p>Kane has been an integral part of WWE ever since his debut more than two decades ago. It is only recently that Kane has decided to step away from the ring and pursue a career in politics since he's running for mayor of Knox County in Tennesse. The former World Champion has been wrestling full-time for the past 23 years and at the age of 50, it seems like a sensible idea to finally walk away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kane has been married&nbsp;to Crystal Maurisa Goins ever since 1995, which was the year that Kane made his WWE debut and together they have two daughters. Kane recently appeared on Chris Jericho's Talk is Jericho podcast where he revealed that his daughter was now a mother as well and he was a grandfather at quite a young age. It is unknown if Kane will return to WWE in the future if he is elected, but he has a tight-knit family supporting him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6toaWVixLixjKyrmqqjYsSmecOim6esXaC7sMOMsJyrnV2cv6K6w5%2BYraCVp8Bw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-are-jesus-ferreiras-parents-jesus-ferreira-biography-parents-name-nationality-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Who are Jesus Ferreiras Parents?
