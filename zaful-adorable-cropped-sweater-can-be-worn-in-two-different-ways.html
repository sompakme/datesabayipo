A two-in-one fashion find is always a major score. Traditionally, this type of piece is usually just reversible. While we love having the option of rocking two different types of prints or colors, what if we could find something that offers two separate styles?"><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Traditionally, this type of piece is usually just reversible. While we love having the option of rocking two different types of prints or colors, what if we could find something that offers <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two separate styles</a>?</p><p>This <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sweater from ZAFUL</a> takes the meaning of “reversible” to an entirely new level. With this garment, you’re getting a two-in-one sweater that’s going to change up your look every time that you wear it. And if that’s not strong enough of a selling point, you can snag it on sale right now for a seriously incredible price!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ZAFUL-Womens-V-Neck-Criss-Cross-Twisted-Sweater.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ZAFUL Women’s V-Neck Criss Cross Twisted Sweater</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$12</a> at Amazon!

It’s not a chunky knit, but it’s thick enough to wear in the wintertime. Simply put, it’s a cropped sweater that’s ideal to pair with high-waisted jeans, skirts or any other type of bottoms.</p><p>But of course, the detail we want to highlight is the twist-tie at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the front of the sweater</a> — because that particular feature makes this a two-in-one piece! You can choose to wear this sweater with the tie in the front for a midriff-baring look or flip it around for a backless aesthetic. The way you decide to wear it can completely transform the look of your outfit — think of it as a modern take on reversible clothing that we’re totally obsessed with!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ZAFUL-Womens-V-Neck-Criss-Cross-Twisted-Sweater-2.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ZAFUL Women’s V-Neck Criss Cross Twisted Sweater</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$12</a> at Amazon!
