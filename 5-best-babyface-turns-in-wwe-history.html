<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>5 Best Babyface Turns In WWE History</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#>WWE</a> has seen some of the biggest babyface turns in the history of this business. The company has created a litany of megastars through face turns. The overwhelming support from fans has allowed many of these stars to transcend barriers.</p><p>Pulling the trigger on a face turn can be a career-changing move for a WWE superstar. After all, there’s no bigger feeling than being cheered on by thousands of fans in the arena. For these men and women, turning babyface put them on a completely different level.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-sami-zayn-betrays-the-bloodline-wwe-royal-rumble-2023>Sami Zayn betrays The Bloodline (WWE Royal Rumble 2023)</h2><p>Sami Zayn’s inclusion in The Bloodline breathed new life into the faction. His involvement led to some of the most memorable and highest-rated segments on WWE television in 2022 and 2023. Sami’s quick wit and comic timing turned him into an instant crowd favorite.</p><p>Fans wanted the Honorary Uce to break away from The Bloodline. After months of slow build, Sami would finally turn on The Bloodline by cracking Roman Reigns’ back with a steel chair at WWE Royal Rumble 2023.</p><p>The spot led to one of the loudest pops in recent memory. Zayn would soon become the number one contender for the Tribal Chief’s title. He would receive the biggest pop of the night at Elimination Chamber in Canada, but failed to beat Reigns for his championship in one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best WWE PLE matches of 2023</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>LA Knight</h2><p>No superstar in modern history has been able to organically get themselves over with the WWE Universe like LA Knight. Knight was all over the Crown Jewel 2022 press conference even though he wasn’t physically present at the event.</p><p>Despite losing high-profile matches and getting screwed out of championship opportunities, the Megastar remains one of the most popular stars on the main roster. It remains to be seen if he will win his first major singles title on the main roster in the near future.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Becky Lynch</h2><p>Becky Lynch’s rise to the mountain top is well documented. The Man had been getting huge reactions from the WWE Universe when she got injured by Nia Jax. The injury turned out to be a blessing in disguise because of the strong fan reception.</p><p>Lynch would get a huge pop at the 2019 Women’s Royal Rumble. She’d win the over-the-top-rope extravaganza to earn a title match at WrestleMania 35. The Biggest Show of the Year would see her beat both Charlotte Flair and Ronda Rousey to become a double champion.</p><p>The rest is history.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Batista makes his decision (WWE RAW)</h2><p>Batista’s turn in 2005 is arguably the most significant one of the Ruthless Aggression Era. The Animal closely watched as his Evolution mentor Triple H ruthlessly extended his “reign of terror”. Nobody was safe from The Game, not even Randy Orton, who’d been a part of the faction.</p><p>Fans knew a face turn was in the making for Batista. They just didn’t know when. The Animal would claim his spot in the WrestleMania 21 main event by winning the Royal Rumble. Batista would reluctantly lift The Cerebral Assassin on his shoulders following his controversial win at No Way Out 2005.</p><p>All of these events would lead to a fateful night on WWE RAW. Batista would be joined by Triple H, Ric Flair and the General Managers of RAW and SmackDown in the ring. The Animal would pick SmackDown’s contract to witness thumbs up from Hunter and Flair only for him to give them thumbs down and take out the duo.</p><p>The crowd erupted as Batista caught Triple H in a powerbomb position and planted the World Heavyweight Champion on the table. The main event of WrestleMania 21 was official. At the event, Batista beat Triple H to win the first of his six world titles in WWE.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2024/01/WWE-Steve-Austin-vs.-Bret-Hart.jpg><h2>Steve Austin’s face turn changed the game</h2><p>Steve Austin was shunned by WCW because they thought of him as a mid-carder at best. Austin joined Vince McMahon’s WWE as the Ringmaster in 1995. He would soon ditch the gimmick to become Steve Austin.</p><p>Austin’s charisma and in-ring work caught the attention of Bret Hart. The Hitman requested to work with the former WCW performer. The pair would have their first singles PPV match at Survivor Series 1996.</p><p>Their second and inarguably the most important one-on-one match-up would come at WrestleMania 13. Both men would tear the house down in inarguably one of the greatest wrestling matches of all time.</p><p>The pivotal final moment would see a bloody and battered Austin refuse to submit to the Sharpshooter, causing special referee Ken Shamrock to declare the match in Bret’s favor. The career-making performance would put the Rattlesnake on top of WWE and eventually lead to a ratings triumph over WCW.</p><h2>Honorable Mentions</h2><ul><li>Randy Savage (WrestleMania 7)</li><li>The Rock (RAW is WAR 1999)</li><li>Hulk Hogan (WWE WrestleMania X8)</li><li>John Cena (2003)</li><li>Daniel Bryan (2014)</li></ul><p>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Best MVP Performances In Royal Rumble History</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZpudo6l6uL7ErKuloZ6cfHKAk2lta2tdanqjsdKtZJuZkq6zoq%2FEZquuqp6oeqq6jLCunmWYnsC1u9Gy</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-was-michael-jackson-never-close-with-his-sister-latoya.html><span>←</span><span>Why Was Michael Jackson Never Close With His Sister, Latoya?</span></a>
