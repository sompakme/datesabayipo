But I’ve got what my mom [<a href=#>Princess Diana</a>, who died in August 1997] left me and without that, we would not have been able to do this.”</p><p class=p1>Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, <a href=#>who wed in May 2018</a>, had been living off an income provided by the English crown — which Charles controlled. After the married couple <a href=#>decided to take a step back from their royal duties</a>, His Majesty was also reluctant to speak to them.</p><p class=p1>“[He stopped] because, by that point, I took matters into my own hands,” Harry said during the tell-all interview. “It was like, ‘I need to do this for my family.’ This is&nbsp;not a surprise to anybody. It’s <a href=#>really sad that it’s gotten to this point</a>, but I’ve got to do <a href=#>something for my own mental health</a>, my wife’s and for Archie’s, as well, because I could see where this was headed.”</p><p class=p1>He continued: “I will always love him, but there’s a lot of hurt that’s happened. And I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship.”</p><p class=p1>The BetterUp CIO and the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Suits&nbsp;</i></a>alum eventually <a href=#>relocated from London to Montecito, California</a>, where they are raising their two children: <a href=#>Archie</a>, born in 2019, and <a href=#>Lilibet</a>, born in 2021.</p><p class=p1>Charles, for his part, <a href=#>has not publicly addressed the family rift</a>&nbsp;but did <a href=#>reunite with Harry at the April 2021 funeral</a> for his late father, <a href=#>Prince Philip</a>.</p><p class=p1>“It was hard. Especially spending time, having chats with my brother [<a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a>] and my father, who just, you know, were very much focused on the same misinterpretation of the whole situation,” Harry <a href=#>recalled of the family reunion</a> in his&nbsp;<i>Harry & Meghan&nbsp;</i>documentary, which premiered on Netflix in December 2022. “<a href=#>None of us really wanted to have to talk about it</a> at my grandfather’s funeral, but we did.”</p><p class=p1>Harry returned home to Meghan and Archie <a href=#>after the funeral for the late Duke of Edinburgh</a>, months before the couple <a href=#>welcomed Lilibet the following June.</a></p><p class=p1>As <a href=#>the&nbsp;<i>Spare&nbsp;</i>scribe</a> and the&nbsp;<i>Daters’ Handbook&nbsp;</i>actress remained <a href=#>focused on their California-based brood</a>, they reunited with Charles — and the other members of the royal family — again after<a href=#> Queen Elizabeth II</a> died<a href=#> in September 2022 at the age of 96.</a> Harry and Meghan <a href=#>both attended her state funeral</a> in London, and <a href=# rel>received a subtle shoutout from the king</a> in his first speech as monarch. (The former Prince of Wales ascended the throne after the queen’s death.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I think the king has made it very clear that he wants to heal the rift. Family dynamics, of course, are always complicated, but I think we can all see that there’s a great deal of pain,” royal expert <strong>Gareth Russell</strong> <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>at the time</a>, referring to the king’s remarks about sending Harry and Meghan “love” while living abroad. “The king, even when he was Prince of Wales, I think has made it very clear that he would, he would like a better relationship with the Duke of Sussex. So let’s hope that the olive branch is something that works.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to revisit Harry and Charles’ ups and downs:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvbO1zZycZqCRp7%2B6ecqipaBlk52us7jErGSioZmoera80maYp5xdmby4utJmq6KllaG2r7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pedro-de-la-vega-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Pedro De La Vega Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
