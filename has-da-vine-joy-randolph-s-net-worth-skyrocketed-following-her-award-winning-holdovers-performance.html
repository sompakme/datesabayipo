However, this is working out for her since her incredible performance in The Holdovers was recognized by so many.</p><p>Randolph told The Hollywood Reporter:</p><p>"Sometimes I think being a woman in this industry, I’ve been very focused, making strategic moves in my career of what I say yes and no to.
