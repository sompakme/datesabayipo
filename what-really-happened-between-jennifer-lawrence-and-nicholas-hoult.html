Some of them turn out to be life-long relationships, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, who have been together for decades</a>. Others have a very short shelf life, like Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult's relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoult has had a very successful career starting from when he was a kid</a>&nbsp;in About A Boy, and Lawrence has seen the same success in her career as well with The Hunger Games. When they met on the set of X-Men: First Class, they started to date and became a powerhouse couple, at least for a little while.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lawrence has dated a lot in recent years</a>, but what exactly happened to the couple who bonded over being blue&nbsp;mutants in the X-Men films and found themselves in a four-year relationship? Let's just say fighting aliens was easier.</p><h2 id=being-superheroes-made-them-fall-in-love>Being Superheroes Made Them Fall In Love</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoult and Lawrence met before filming for X-Men started,</a> during a screen test in 2010. If you're a fan of the superhero films, you'll probably remember that their characters, Hank, a.k.a. Beast, and Mystique, or Raven, had some great scenes together. There was even a little bit of romance between them which obviously translated to real-life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After X-Men: First Class, and dating for a few months, the couple debuted on the red carpet of the Screen Actors Guild awards in 2011. Hoult was Lawrence's date for the evening.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things Jennifer Lawrence Has Done Since The Last Hunger Games Movie</a></span></p><p>In 2014, Hoult bought a house in London for the pair of them, and according to his sister, he bought all the furniture from IKEA. Doesn't that sound like the most comfortably domestic thing ever? He apparently had a thing for feng shui too.</p><p>But like all couples, they fought sometimes, and one of the things Lawrence&nbsp;did when she was angry was to yell at Hoult in a southern accent.</p><p>She told Entertainment Tonight, "Nick always said whenever I yelled at him it was always in a Southern accent. I used to yell at Nick and kind of see like his smile flickering. [I was] like, 'Why are you smiling?' And he's like, 'Because you sound like your dad.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Jennifer Lawrence Is Mean To Her Fans</a></span></p><p>When Lawrence did it Hoult&nbsp;couldn't be mad at her anymore because he thought it was cute. On top of that, the couple mutually agreed not to get mad at each other when they were busy and working. So more often than not, they ignored each other a little when they were on set of their respective movies.</p><p>Among all of these little relationship quirks they had, including the pranks that Lawrence loved to pull on her boyfriend, one of the biggest things that they loved about each other was the fact that they both admired that they weren't affected by their fame.</p><h2 id=it-wasn-t-that-great-at-times>It Wasn't That Great At Times</h2><p>The couple called it quits in 2013, but when they had to come back together for&nbsp;X-Men: Days of Future Past,&nbsp;their romance was reignited and they got back together. But shortly after their second try, they broke up for a final time. Sources at the time blamed their conflicting schedules, and that they had ended things amicably.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then there was the outrageous incident of Lawrence's phone getting hacked and private photos, which she was going to send to Hoult, being leaked. That situation probably didn't help their break up.</p><p>In 2015 though, after the couple had broken up, an eyewitness allegedly saw the couple have a screaming match in a restaurant. No doubt the eyewitness heard that quirky little change of accent that Lawrence does, but we don't think Hoult found it all too cute this time.</p><p>After the X-Men movies ended, and their relationship, Lawrence revealed to Diane Sawyer that both of those things ending had a great effect on her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s What Hugh Jackman Thinks Of His ‘X-Men’ Co-Star, Jennifer Lawrence</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"These movies had been my life for so long and they had to come first in everything," she said. "I was also in a relationship with somebody for five years and that was my life. So my life was this person and these movies, and we broke up around the same time that I wrapped those movies. Being 24 was this whole year of, 'Who am I without these movies? Who am I without this man?'"</p><p>But Lawrence didn't know that the X-Men films weren't actually over at the time. X-Men: Dark Phoenix came out in 2019, and she once again got to work with Hoult, though this time as exes.</p><p>But when they were making Dark Phoenix both said that they were able to be professional and work as friends. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoult even compared it to going back to school.</a></p><p>Lawrence thinks that the reason she's able to be amicable with her exes is&nbsp;because she can be blunt about things.</p><p>"I think it’s because I’m blunt," she said. "I don’t think that you can have any sort of bad relationship with anybody if you’re just blunt. Everybody always knows how you feel at all times and there’s no lying. It’s just honesty."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well if that isn't a pretty great motto we don't know what is. They say honesty is the best policy and Lawrence and Hoult seemed to have lived by that. That's the reason they can still act together in some of our favorite movies. Maybe they should teach this to a lot of couples in Hollywood.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lawrence Almost Got This Role In A Quentin Tarantino Movie</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BmrculsGagkaW9prrEnWSbnaSssqa6jKOcp6aZm7Kzecuarqudnpiybq3NnWSnoZOdvK2t0mafqK2cqXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ksi-vs-tommy-fury-undercard-who-else-is-on-misfits-prime-card-with-logan-paul-vs-dillon-danis-doubl.html><span>←</span><span>KSI vs Tommy Fury undercard: Who else is on Misfits Prime card with Logan Paul vs Dillon Danis doubl</span></a>
