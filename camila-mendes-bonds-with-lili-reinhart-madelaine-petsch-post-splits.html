Me, Madelaine and Lili, specifically, we’ve never been closer than we are this season.”</p><p>The Palm Springs actress reflected on their close connection, explaining, “It’s really nice to have them, to feel like I do have friendships here — meaningful ones.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Riverdale-Stars-Camila-Mendes-Lili-Reinhart-Madelaine-Petsch-Have-Never-Been-Closer-Promo.jpg><p>Mendes previously dated Riverdale costar <strong><a href=#>Charles Melton</a></strong> from 2018 to 2019. She recently <a href=#>split</a> from photographer <a href=#><strong>Grayson Vaughn</strong> </a>after nearly one year of dating.</p><p>Reinhart, 24, was in a relationship with costar <a href=#><strong>Cole Sprouse</strong></a> on and off for three years until their <a href=#>split</a> in May 2020. The Swimming Lessons author <a href=#>described</a> that period of time as a “<a href=#>black tunnel [that] was never going to end</a>” during an August 2020 interview with Refinery29.</p><p>“I couldn’t see the light. I was like, I feel like I’m dying. It was fucking rough, and there’s no other way through it than just through it,” Reinhart said at the time. “I’ve seen a lot of people when it comes to heartache and grief and breakups, and they try to get that void filled with sex, with coke, with food, with drinking, [but] the void is still there. I took the road less traveled and just dealt with my shit. I had to face my own pain head-on.”</p><p>Petsch, for her part, went through a split of her own. In February 2020, Us Weekly <a href=#>broke the news</a> that she and <a href=#><strong>Travis Mills</strong></a> broke up after nearly three years together.</p><p>The bond between the Riverdale leads has only gotten stronger as they continue to film season 5 of The CW series during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. With quarantine keeping everyone in Vancouver, Mendes recently shared with Us what she learned about Reinhart in that time.</p><p>“Lili makes a lot of noise when she sleeps. Like, she’s a sleep talker. She told me this because she downloaded an app where you can record yourself sleeping and see if you say anything,” The Dangerous Lies actress <a href=#>explained exclusively</a> to Us in March. “I think it’s more to measure how long you sleep and if you sleep well that night, but it’ll record you when you’re making noises.”</p><p>The Perfect Date star added: “Lili played some for Madelaine [Petsch] and me, and we were dying of laughter. She, like, mumbles so much, and that’s something I never knew until this season.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Mendes also shared with Us how the Riverdale crew continue to keep in contact since the show’S 2017 debut.</p><p>“I wouldn’t say we FaceTime a lot because we are around each other so much, so there’s really no need. Our group text is active. There’s a lot of TikToks being sent back and forth,” the Virginia native said. “We’re always texting each other when personal things happen. We very much lean on each other.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZ2euaJ5zJ6lnZ2jYq%2BwusOsZLChpJ16rbXLomSrnZmjtaK%2B02akmpyVoa6qusRmp56so5i1brzOrKtmq6ChtrW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angelina-jolie-plans-to-drag-out-divorce-until-her-youngest-kids-with-brad-pitt-turn-18.html><span>←</span><span>Angelina Jolie Plans To Drag Out Divorce Until Her Youngest Kids With Brad Pitt Turn 18</span></a>
