As Ryan explained during a 2019 interview, humor is a way of keeping their relationship healthy: "Oh yeah, we do once in a while [...] I think it’s a sign of a healthy relationship, personally. I do, yeah."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-always-work-as-a-team><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They Always Work As A Team</span></h2><p>Blake and Ryan are inseparable and they see each other as being part of a team.</p><p>As Blake told Vogue in 2014: "Everything we do in life we do together. If I’m working on a movie, he helps me with my character; I do the same with him. Picking out a coffee table. What we’re going to eat. He’s a beautiful writer—he’s written a lot of stuff for us. And he’s got a great barometer and he knows me, so he will tell me if&nbsp;[something] is&nbsp;not as good as it can be." That's a great lesson for any couple.</p><h2 id=they-are-fully-committed-to-the-family-they-built-together><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Are Fully Committed To the Family They Built Together</span></h2><p>They are the ultimate working parents, two movie stars with crazy shooting schedules in often far-flung locations. However, Blake and Ryan have expressed many times how committed they are to their daughters and on spending time together as a family.</p><p>"My husband and I don’t work at the same time, so we all go together as a family. If we’re away as a family, it’s never more than for a day. We stay together," Blake told People in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About The Way Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds Parent Their Kids</a></span></p><h2 id=they-have-absolute-trust-in-each-other><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>They Have Absolute Trust In Each Other</span></h2><p>Trust is a pillar of any strong relationship, but even the best couples may not be as trusting as Blake was of Ryan recently when she hinted she was going to ask him to color her hair.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram story</a>, Blake thanked her colorist Rona O'Connor for a surprise hair coloring set she sent her and then joked "The fact that you trust @vancityreynolds to get this right makes me concerned for your sanity. But who needs hair anyway!?" finding again a way to tease Ryan but also to show the world their loving relationship. We can't wait to see Blake's hair!</p><h2 id=they-are-not-afraid-to-share-their-love-publicly><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>They Are Not Afraid To Share Their Love Publicly</span></h2><p>Unlike some other couples in the public eye, Blake and Ryan are not the kind to put a facade when out and about or during their many public engagements. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they have even flirted via their Instagram stories</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple is clearly comfortable sharing the spotlight together, whether in candids caught by a lucky photographer, or more glamorous shots on the red carpet. One thing is for sure, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their body language says it all</a>: Blake and Ryan are very much in love.</p><h2 id=they-are-each-other-s-best-friend><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Are Each Other’s Best Friend</span></h2><p>It's a fact the couple has repeated many times throughout the years.</p><p>As Blake revealed to Marie Claire in 2016, their close friendship was the reason she knew she wanted to marry Ryan: "I knew he would always be my best friend for my whole life. [...] I’d never known anything like the friendship that I had with him. I could like him as much as I loved him."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Sweet Photos Of Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds Through The Years</a></span></p><h2 id=they-never-miss-the-opportunity-to-share-their-admiration-for-each-other><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Never Miss The Opportunity To Share Their Admiration For Each Other</span></h2><p>This couple is very vocal about their mutual admiration!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My wife, Blake, is like an alien, like MacGyver had a baby with Brigitte Bardot. The most interesting thing about me is her," Ryan said during his acceptance speech after being inducted into Canada Walk of Fame in 2014. "You are the best thing that has ever happened to me … you make everything better, absolutely everything in my life," he also told Blake in 2016 when he accepted his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><h2 id=they-continuously-learn-from-each-other><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Continuously Learn From Each Other</span></h2><p>It's something Ryan&nbsp;mentioned&nbsp;when talking about Blake, crediting his wife with helping grow as a person and becoming more sympathetic.</p><p>"She always responds with empathy. She meets anger with empathy. She meets hate with empathy [...] And she's made me a more empathetic person," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan told Humans of New York</a> in 2017.</p><h2 id=they-fully-support-each-other-s-careers><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Fully Support Each Other's Careers</span></h2><p>Though it helps that they are both movie stars, we think it's also the fact they so openly support each other's careers that keeps Ryan and Blake's marriage strong.</p><p>Whether&nbsp;they're&nbsp;attending each other's movie premieres&nbsp;or promoting non-movie projects on Instagram, Blake and Ryan never think twice about supporting each other in public. "It's nice to have a partner in everything," Blake told E! News in 2014 about the support she had received from Ryan throughout her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Reynolds Loves Making Jokes At His Family's Expense</a></span></p><h2 id=they-were-co-stars-and-good-friends-before-they-became-a-couple><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They Were Co-Stars And Good Friends Before They Became A Couple</span></h2><p>Their story is truly a wonderful one. Blake and Ryan were cast to star together in The Green Lantern in 2010.&nbsp; The co-stars played each other's love interest on-screen, while off-screen they became good friends. The friendship turned into something more special a long time after they met, when they both found themselves single.</p><p>"We were friends for two years before we were ever dating. And I treat him like my girlfriend," Blake has said of Ryan. The Deadpool&nbsp;has echoed this sentiment about his wife: "It was weird at first, but we were buddies for a long time. I think it's the best way to have a relationship is to start as friends."</p><h2 id=they-give-each-other-very-thoughtful-gifts><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Give Each Other Very Thoughtful Gifts</span></h2><p>Despite having the wealth to probably fulfill every one of their material fantasies, Blake and Ryan actually keep their gift-giving very personal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Normally, we make something for each other. Because that's something that lasts and isn't something you just found and bought in a store," Blake told E! News in 2014. You just need to look at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this painting </a>that Blake commissioned for Ryan in 2019 to see what she means!</p><h2 id=honesty-and-communication-are-key-in-their-relationship><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Honesty And Communication Are Key In Their Relationship</span></h2><p>In fact, the couple keeps it real by fully addressing their issues with each other and not bringing others into the picture. As Blake explained to Glamour in 2017: "In other relationships, if something came up, I would call my girlfriends or my sister, and say, "Hey, this is what he did—what should I do?" Where with him,&nbsp; [...] I’m like, "Hey, this happened. It upset me. This is how I feel. What do I do?" And he does the same for me. He treats me like his best buddy."</p><p>Whatever this gorgeous couple is doing, it sure is working!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Throwback Pics Of Blake Lively Too Good To Ignore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZpZmbmnqttdWeo7JlkaOxbr7YmqVmqpWuu7C4w6xkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXWZ9bsXEmqmsZaSevbR506ugnKOjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hot-see-dwts-william-levy-as-a-naked-sexy-cowboy.html><span>←</span><span>Hot!
