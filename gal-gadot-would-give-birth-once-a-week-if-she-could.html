I was 25 when I was pregnant with Alma. I always wanted to be a young mother.

The connection was there from the beginning before everything, so it always felt very real and very good. I’m super grateful that I got to meet him when I was 20.

Alma, still at 9, sneaks into our bed. … I think that’s what we’re going to stick to doing, we’re going to sleep train her, we’re going to make sure she loves and enjoys sleep.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGagmZxitKKwzq1ksKelobFus8ivnGaamafBqXnOp5qeZZFixKaxymagn2WjnbJur86uo51n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-you-shave-your-pubic-hair.html><span>←</span><span>Do You Shave Your Pubic Hair?</span></a>
