The<a href=#> Real Housewives of Beverly Hills </a>alum announced that she became a grandma on Saturday, November 13, when daughter <strong>Pandora Vanderpump Sabo</strong> gave birth to her first child.</p><p>“Obsessively in love with baby Theodore,” the Vanderpump Rules star, 61, wrote via Instagram. “Thank you Pandy and Jason for making me a Nanny Pinky!”</p><p>The LVP Sangria founder, 35, who wed<strong> Jason Sabo</strong> in August 2011, also shared a birth announcement on Instagram, revealing that they nicknamed the baby Teddy.</p><p>“6lb 7oz of pure delicious joy,” Pandora captioned a photo of her hand and the newborn’s hand. “Your entrance into this world was the best day of our entire lives and your daddy and I are so thankful that you are here, healthy and happy. You are so loved little Teddy!”</p><p>The new mom <a href=#>debuted her baby bump</a> 10 years after marrying Sabo. The expectant star attended the Annual World Dog Day with her mom in August 2021, showing her budding belly in a floral dress.</p><p>“It is such a blessing after such a difficult year for everyone,” the “beyond thrilled” Pandora told the Daily Mail at the time. “We are so excited about this new chapter in our lives.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-11-13-at-5.36.50-PM.png><p>Lisa chimed in, “Ken and I are overjoyed and are so happy for Pandora and Jason. It’s such wonderful news and has been such a difficult secret to keep.”</p><p>Later that same month, the<a href=#> Vanderpump Rules </a>star exclusively told Us Weekly that she<a href=#> wants the little one to call her Nanny Pinky</a>. “They liked it,” the Bravo personality said of Pandora and Jason, also 35. “That’s not any indication of what she’s having.”</p><p>The reality star noted that her daughter kept her pregnancy news under wraps “for a long time,” telling her parents with an ultrasound photo.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“She gave me a <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> and inside was the sonogram, and she videoed it,” Lisa recalled at the time. “She videoed every step of me opening this thing and saying, ‘Oh, my God!’ … We’re all very, very excited. How can we not be? Pandora’s a very tactile and loving person and loves on her dog like a baby. She’s very much like me. Pandora and Jason [will make] lovely parents, and it’s a blessing.”</p><p>While the Simply Divine author has previously spoken about her desire to become a grandma, she was intentional about not pressuring her daughter and son-in-law.</p><p>“People are saying, ‘Would you put pressure on them?’ I absolutely wouldn’t because it’s got to be them that’s got to raise the child. And it’s got to be them that’s gonna be up [with the baby],” Lisa told The Daily Dish in 2019. “And it’s gotta be the time in your life when you’re ready for it. I think they’re kind of prepared, but I think Jason’s been traveling a lot. So I think they want that to slow down a little bit [first].”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaloaOWeretzZ2cq6ilor20ecOarKCgpJq%2FbrzAp5uoqpFixKa4wqiknqtdZsC1ecKhoKWcXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gwen-stefani-s-best-fashion-and-beauty-moments-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Gwen Stefanis Best Fashion and Beauty Moments: Pics</span></a>
