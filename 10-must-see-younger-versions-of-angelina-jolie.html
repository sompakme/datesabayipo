Surprisingly though, she has many uncanny lookalikes from all around the globe, from fellow Hollywood movie stars to regular folks who make a living impersonating her (and some who want nothing to do with the woman they so resemble). There are a few women who could be her actual twin, meaning they are the same age as her, such as Aishwarya Rai of Bollywood fame, but on the flip side, Jolie has also been compared to the loathsome "Octomom", Nadya Suleman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Angelina Jolie is one of Hollywood's highest paid actresses, having appeared in countless feature films, including Salt, Changeling, and Maleficent. A mother to six (three of whom were adopted internationally) who promotes several causes such as education and women's rights.</p><p>Oscar winner, Goodwill Ambassador, alleged homewrecker, and sex symbol-the list goes on. But it is her notable physical features that have led several media outlets to label her the "Sexiest Woman Alive" and the "Most Beautiful Woman in the World". Those features are the combination of her numerous tattoos, light eyes, and full lips. While most women could not hope to fill the shoes of the woman a 2015 global survey found to be the world's most admired, they definitely can physically resemble her. In fact, the following beautiful candidates are actually very hard to tell apart from the actress. However, they are all much younger so only time will tell if they will make the transition into mid-life as gracefully (while retaining their beauty) as the lovely Angelina Jolie has.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-dorien-rose-duinker><strong>10. Dorien Rose Duinker</strong></h2><p><strong><a href=#>Dorien Rose Duinker</a></strong> is a Dutch filmmaker, actress, and model. She grew up in Hong Kong, but returned to Holland for school and to begin her modeling career. Now she also works as an Angelina Jolie impersonator. She was Dutch Playmate of the Year 2004, has graced the covers of several magazines, the likes of Glamour, Elle, and Cosmo Girl, and was the face of multiple campaigns, including one for Revlon. She has been in numerous Dutch films, the most famous being Amsterdam Heavy, and worked as a radio/television host, though most of her work is as a model.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-veronika-black><strong>9. Veronika Black</strong></h2><p>This model says her looks are ruining her love life, and that men are scared off because of them. She claims that women are afraid she will steal their men, much like Angelina Jolie did, herself. Veronika Black was first compared to the famous Hollywood star in 2011 when she began injecting her lips. Her only other noteworthy surgery is her enhanced 32J-sized breasts, and she is adamant to those who question her that she has had no other surgery to look like Jolie. Despite being blessed with the natural Jolie-esque beauty, the 27-year-old from Vancouver says she was bullied in school, and did not have a boyfriend until she was 18. She currently lives in Dubai to promote her modeling career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-india-eisley><strong>8. India Eisley</strong></h2><p><strong><a href=#>India Eisley</a></strong> did not have to go far to be discovered. She was born to a musician father and an actress mother, (who she appeared in the 2005 movie Headspace with) in Los Angeles. Although no one has openly ever compared the younger actress to Angelina Jolie, it is not hard to picture. India gained most of her notoriety on five seasons of The Secret Life of the American Teenager, and more recently appeared alongside<strong> <a href=#>Samuel L. Jackson</a></strong> in the 2014 action film Kite, the modern re-telling of Romeo and Juliet called Social Suicide the same year, and 2015's dark fantasy The Curse of Sleeping Beauty, as Briar Rose.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-lisa-haydon><strong>7. Lisa Haydon</strong></h2><p>Model/actress/fashion designer <strong><a href=#>Lisa Haydon</a></strong> has beauty that rivals <strong><a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a></strong>'s. Hers is a blend of Indian and Australian ancestry that has made her a notable Jolie lookalike. Born in India and raised in the U.S. and Australia, she eventually moved back to India to follow in her sister's footsteps; <strong><a href=#>Malika Haydon</a> </strong>had found success there as a model, and Lisa hoped to do the same. So far, she has appeared in a few movies and television shows in Bollywood, and is also the first Indian fashion designer to design her line internationally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-tiffany-claus><strong>6. Tiffany Claus</strong></h2><p>While American model and actress <strong><a href=#>Tiffany Claus </a></strong>is most well-known for her striking&nbsp; resemblance to Angelina Jolie, she is also an accomplished mezzo-soprano vocalist, and a professional oil painter. She double-majored in Psychology and Art/Design, and has a minor in Art History. She has appeared in several magazines such as Maxim and People, films like Meet the Spartans&nbsp;and television shows, including Chelsea Lately and The Tyra Banks Show. She is an official Angelina Jolie Impersonator.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-miranda-kerr><strong>5. Miranda Kerr</strong></h2><p><strong><a href=#>Miranda Kerr</a></strong> is well-known as one of Victoria's Secret's glamorous Angels, though despite their obvious similarities, is not often compared to Miss Jolie. She is her own person and celebrity. Born and raised in Australia, it may surprise you to learn that much of her childhood was spent racing motorbikes and riding horses on her grandmother's farm. She began modeling at 13, and there was some outrage at her Dolly Magazine photo-shoot in a bikini; some even called it pedophilia.&nbsp; The first Australian to be offered a contract with Victoria's Secret, she has also been the face of several brands, including Swarovski and H & M. She married&nbsp;<strong><a href=#> Orlando Bloom</a></strong> but the two are separated, and in 2015 she began dating billionaire Snapchat founder/CEO<strong> <a href=#>Evan Spiegel</a></strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-lina-sanz><strong>4. Lina Sanz</strong></h2><p><strong><a href=#>Lina Sanz</a></strong> is a Spanish actress now living in London. She became famous because of her uncanny likeness to Angelina Jolie, and was discovered through a YouTube video she posted. In it, she introduced herself and said she would love to get work as Angelina's double. But even though she is one of the closest lookalikes to the celeb that I have seen, the subtle differences led crushable.com to say, "There's still something in her expression that doesn't scream 'Hollywood actress, humanitarian, and mother to Brad Pitt's kids'." She is now signed with the Susan Scott Agency who specialize in finding celebrity lookalikes.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-victoria-furnari><strong>3. Victoria Furnari</strong></h2><p><strong>Victoria Furnari</strong> is an Argentinian model currently living in New York with her boyfriend and model, Thomas Guarrachino. She keeps being mistaken for Angelina Jolie, and the 24-year-old says that recently she did a photoshoot in France in which she "played" the Hollywood star. But when it comes to her, she does not think she looks much like the famous actress. Everyone else seems to disagree though, so she has gotten more modeling business because of it. Having modeled since the age of 15, she has done commercials for several brands, including Playboy, Coca-Cola, Avon, L'Oreal, and Calvin Klein.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-priyanka-chopra><strong>2. Priyanka Chopra</strong></h2><p>Bollywood recruit <strong><a href=#>Priyanka Chopra</a></strong> has recently joined the Hollywood crowd, after taking on the role of FBI trainee Alex Parrish in ABC's Quantico, thus also becoming America's first South Asian actress in a leading role on prime time television. In 2000 she won Miss India and Miss World, so the comparison to one of Hollywood's most beautiful women is an easy one. Like Angelina, she is also known for her full lips, and she is also a humanitarian, dedicating her efforts to many causes involving women, such as their education and female infanticide.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-chelsea-marr><strong>1. Chelsea Marr</strong></h2><p>The craziest lookalike of them all, 24-year-old Chelsea Marr has been called Angelina Jolie's "younger twin". She certainly could be! The Scottish beauty works for an oil and gas recruitment company as an Operations Manager, and said that her newfound fame has been somewhat of a challenge at work since all of the attention has been a "strain". That fame is all due to Instagram, where people all over the world started noticing her resemblance to Angelina, though she has only ever had one surgery, a breast augmentation. She has turned down modeling job offers to keep her current one, so it is not surprising that in interviews she is very candid, humble, and down to earth, even with all of the recent attention.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong>: <a href=#>wikipedia.org</a><strong><a href=#>,</a></strong><a href=#> imdb.com</a>, <a href=#>ibtimes.com</a>, <a href=#>crushable.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmpoXa68trrGnqlmrpWnwKq7zaxkqJ5dlruoscuipZplmqS5qrGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-artists-and-bands-who-own-their-master-recordings.html><span>←</span><span>10 Artists and Bands Who Own Their Master Recordings</span></a>
