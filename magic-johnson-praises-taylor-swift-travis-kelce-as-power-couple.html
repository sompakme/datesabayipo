Another basketball star, Shaquille O’Neal, <a href=#>similarly commented on the couple</a> on Friday, February 9 at Shaq’s Fun House pe-Super Bowl party in Las Vegas.</p><p>“I wouldn’t give any advice to him. I’m not the expert on that,” he said. “Hopefully they last forever and they get married and have beautiful children.”</p><p>Former tight end <a href=#><strong>Rob Gronkowski</strong></a> also shared his excitement about the new attention Swift and Kelce have <a href=#>brought to the NFL</a>.
