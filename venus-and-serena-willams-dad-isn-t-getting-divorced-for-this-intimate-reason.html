However, some athletes have made enough of an impact that their lives have also been covered by the tabloid press. For example, whenever <a href=#>pro athletes gets involved with a major star</a>, that is a quick way to make sure they show up in the tabloids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>18 Athletes That Tried To Date Celebs… But Got Dumped</a></span></p><p>Since they are both incredibly famous at this point, Venus and Serena Williams are two athletes whose personal lives are a fixture of the tabloids. For example, when it became clear that <a href=#>Serena’s husband donated to Colin Kaepernick's fund to combat racism</a>, that revelation was covered by the press. While that makes some sense since Serena and Venus are so beloved, it is a lot more interesting that their father’s personal life has been covered by the press. For example, it has become known that after Richard Williams and his third wife started divorce proceedings, they reconciled for intimate reasons.</p><h2 id=who-is-venus-and-serena-williams-rsquo-dad>Who Is Venus And Serena Williams’ Dad?</h2><p>Ever since avid tennis fans first heard of Serena and Venus Williams, there has been a lot of talk about the siblings’ father, Richard Williams. After all, unlike most tennis players that go pro, the Williams sisters’ career was guided by their father early on instead of coaches and agents who say they know what is best.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Richard Williams in charge of Serena Williams and Venus Williams’ careers as they began to come of age, his decisions garnered a lot of attention and criticism. For example, when Richard stopped his daughters from taking part in tournaments, some observers began to wonder aloud if he was doing so to garner attention for himself. However, in the years since then, Richard went from being one of the most criticized figures in sports to someone that a lot of people like a lot partially due to <a href=#>how protective he is of his daughters</a>. Of course, it would be a lie to try and pretend like Richard isn’t controversial to this day.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How The Williams Family Finally Said Yes To The Film 'King Richard'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, a new group of people became aware of Richard Williams and his story. The reason for that is the critically acclaimed film King Richard was released with Will Smith bringing the famous sports father to life on the big screen. While an extremely unfortunate event that took place at the 94th Academy Awards overshadowed the moment, Smith infamously won his first Oscar for his portrayal of Richard Williams. Based on the supporting role he played in his daughter’s success and Smith’s famous portrayal of him, it seems all but certain that Richard will go down in history.</p><h2 id=richard-williams-rsquo-most-reason-wife-tried-to-reverse-their-divorce>Richard Williams’ Most Reason Wife Tried To Reverse Their Divorce</h2><p>Back in 1965, Richard Williams married a woman named Betty Johnson and the couple went on to have five children together. Sadly, after several years together, that marriage fell apart and they finalized their divorce in 1973. Far from through, Richard then went on to get involved with Oracene "Brandy" Price and they were wed in 1980. During Richard’s second marriage, his two famous daughters Serena and Venus were born. After more than two decades together, Richard and Oracene ended their marriage in 2002.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>I Do, I Do, I Don't: 10 Celebs With The Most Divorces In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>After Richard Williams’ first two marriages fell apart, he went on to try again when he married <a href=#>Lakeisha Juanita Graham </a>in 2010 even though she is only a year older than his daughter Venus. During their marriage, Lakeisha and Richard welcomed a son into the world. Sadly, in 2017, it seemed like Richard’s third marriage failed just like the other two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shockingly enough, however, the Daily Mail reported that Lakeisha Juanita Graham petitioned the court in March 2022 to cancel the couple’s divorce which still hadn’t been finalized. Given that it has been reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard has suffered strokes and is suffering from dementia</a>, some people may have thought that Lakeisha was staying by his side to take care of him. According to Lakeisha’s court filing, however, the divorce needed to be canceled for much more intimate reasons.</p><p>In the court papers reportedly filed by <a href=#>Lakeisha</a> Juanita Graham’s attorney, it is claimed that she and Richard Williams have been living together again since 2019 and they are raising their son together. More notably, Lakeisha’s paperwork also claims that the divorce proceedings need to be stopped because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has a very healthy intimate life with Richard</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The wife believes that the parties have reconciled and have engaged in an active marital life including having regular weekly sexual relations including but not limited to on January 9, 2022, the night before filing this motion."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Author Complains About 'King Richard' Movie, Ignoring Serena and Venus Williams Involvement</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipopuYlr%2Bledaio6WhkaLAbr%2FPqKysnV2hrqyxyKyfmmWXp66prcxmm6Kun6ewpnmRaWlrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vanessa-bryant-news-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>Vanessa Bryant News - Us Weekly</span></a>
