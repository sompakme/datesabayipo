However, quite a few ladies held their own in a field that caters to many men. Some of these women made their mark all while being fashion icons, sex symbols, yet people of all genders respected their bars. It takes mastery to excel in the hip-hop and rap art forms within itself because it's more than speaking over a beat. While "rap" stands for rhythm and poetry, many people can grasp the "poetic" part, but not necessarily the rhythmic part or vice versa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Call Nicki Minaj, Drake, And Little Wayne’s Collab The Rebirth Of Real Hip Hop</a></span></p><p>Then, add this to the fact that many women's voices in hip hop seem to go unheard. In 2017, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a> covered why rap still has a gender gap. British rapper Lady Leshurr mentioned that men look out for each other more in hip hop. She also noted that colorism is problematic. Let's look at Nicki Minaj and nine other female rappers who broke through many barriers and shaped hip hop.</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-dominated-the-2010s><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Nicki Minaj Dominated The 2010s</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nicki Minaj's mixtape "Beam Me Up Scotty," which she dropped back in 2009, wasn't available on streaming services until May 14th, 2021. "Beam Me Up Scotty" made mixtape history being the highest-charting re-released mixtape in rap history. Before the release, Minaj alluded to something dropping on that Friday. Fans wondered and anticipated if her messaged on IG alluded to an album or a documentary or what, proving that people will always appreciate Minaj's return after she takes hiatuses.</p><p>Before rappers such as Cardi B, Doja Cat, and Megan the Stallion started hitting the airwaves, it seems as if there wasn't much of a market for women rappers in the 2010s. Minaj mainly was all you heard on the radio as she took over both pop and hip hop. Minaj has sold 137 million records worldwide and 19 top ten hits.</p><h2 id=missy-elliott-made-watching-music-videos-an-event><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Missy Elliott Made Watching Music Videos An Event</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Missy Elliot drops a music video, fans expect it to be out of this world. The music video for Missy Elliot's "The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)" is still one of the most unique and avant-garde music videos in general, let alone coming from the rap genre. Elliot made hip hop fun and is known for her eclectic production style regarding hip hop records. In 2019, the VMAs honored her with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. One fan<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> appreciated how most of Elliott's songs talked about sexuality and satisfaction</a>, but she didn't use her body to promote her messages. Elliott sold 30 million records worldwide and has nine top ten hits.</p><h2 id=queen-latifah-demanded-respect><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Queen Latifah Demanded Respect</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the same fashion as Missy Elliott, people did not dub Queen Latifah as a sex symbol, but they loved her jazzy approach to hip hop. When Latifah first arrived on the hip hop scene, she wore dashikis and asked men, "Who you callin' a b****?" in her 1993 song "U.N.I.T.Y." Fast forward decades later, and it seems as if you can't hear many mainstream hip hop and rap songs without this word in it. However, Latifah did more than call out the word. She demanded respect as a woman in the hip-hop genre as a whole.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Dana Elaine Owens Goes By Queen Latifah</a></span></p><p>Then, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she transitioned to making shows, movies, and endorsing cosmetics</a>, but genuine hip hop fans will never forget her roots as a rapper as someone who covered deep topics such as sexual harassment. She sold 2 million records worldwide.</p><h2 id=salt-n-peppa-preached-feminist-values><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Salt-N-Peppa Preached Feminist Values</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Salt-N-Peppa seemed to foster the perfect blend of sexually driven yet conscious messages. Their songs "Push It," "Let's Talk About Sex.", "Whatta Man," featuring En Vogue, and "None Of Your Business" empowered women, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">often in a feminist-like fashion</a>, yet their bars were hard-hitting enough for men to respect them. Plus, the songs were danceable, but Salt-N-Peppa also spoke out against discrimination and assault. Salt-N-Peppa sold 15 million records worldwide.</p><h2 id=lauryn-hill-s-only-solo-studio-album-will-forever-be-a-masterpiece><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lauryn Hill's Only Solo Studio Album Will Forever Be A Masterpiece</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lauryn Hill is as much an R&B singer as she is a rapper. Before Hill embarked on her solo career, she was one-third of the hip hop group the Fugees. In one song alone, titled "Doo Wap (That Thang)," she called out absentee fathers, domestic violence, and the dangers of being intimate with men who are only about chasing money versus love. In this song, she asked the philosophical question, "How you 'gon win, when you ain't right within?" and told people to "come again."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauryn Hill Reveals Why She Never Made Another Album After ‘The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill’</a></span></p><p>"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" sold 20 million records worldwide, and people will forever love Hill for her socially conscious contributions to hip hop and the vulnerability she brought to music. Minaj considered Hill her idol, bowed when she met Hill and told Hot 97 that it was surreal.</p><h2 id=mc-lyte-made-history><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>MC Lyte Made History</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Rap Facts</a>, MC Lyte was the first woman rapper to receive a gold single. Her song "Ruffneck" sold over 500,000 copies. Lyte was also the first woman rapper to release a full album with 1988's "Lyte as a Rock," which received positive reviews and critical acclaims. Lyte was also the first hip-hop artist to perform at Carnegie Hall. MC Lyte came into the rap game at 16 years old and expressed that there wasn't much loyalty and that the older men wanted to dominate this space.</p><h2 id=lil-kim-said-what-some-women-wanted-to-say-but-didn-t><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lil' Kim Said What Some Women Wanted To Say, But Didn't</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The history of women in hip hop has a division between two eras, the era before Lil' Kim and after her. Before Lil' Kim came out, hip-hop had a conscious message that fought against sexism, but Lil' Kim was all about sex appeal. She wore iconic Dolce & Gabbana fashions and wasn't afraid to rap as raunchy as many men did. Lil' proved that women could be sexy and respected. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, Lil' Kim's label didn't understand her sexy look, and she thought she had to wear suits like MC Lyte to gain respect. Worldwide, Lil' Kim has sold more than 15 albums and 30 million singles.</p><h2 id=foxy-brown-also-challenged-hip-hop-s-hypermasculinity><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Foxy Brown Also Challenged Hip-Hop's Hypermasculinity</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aliya King, who has written for many publications such as Vibe, Essence, US Weekly, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">considered rappers Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown a sexual revolution</a>. They expressed things that she didn't feel comfortable saying aloud. In 2021, people are still considering Foxy Brown's "I'll Be Good" featuring Jay-Z, a timeless track. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brown has enough prowess on the song to keep up with Jay-Z</a>, but she wore a brown slinky dress and high heels, proving that skill came in a multitude of packages. As did Nicki Minaj on "Monster," Brown blew her male counterparts out of the water on LL Cool J's "I Shot Ya" remix. At 17, Def Jam signed her, and her debut album "Ill Na Na" went platinum.</p><h2 id=roxanne-shant-recorded-one-of-the-first-ever-diss-tracks><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Roxanne Shanté Recorded One of The First-Ever Diss Tracks</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rappers battle rapped and were braggadocious on songs about how they were the best rapper ever lived. However, "Roxanne's Revenge" called the rap group UTFO out by name. Roxanne Shanté, who was 14, rapped on their beat from the song "Roxanne, Roxanne," where she called the guys out for not being good enough for her. Their original track was about someone who rejected their romantic advances. "Roxanne's Revenge" was a hit, but UTFO released a cease-and-desist order because of the sample used. Shante' recorded a new track over a new beat, and thus the "Roxanne Wars" began.</p><h2 id=people-consider-sha-rock-the-first-female-rapper-in-history><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>People Consider Sha-Rock The First Female Rapper In History</span></h2><p>The hip-hop community considered Sha-Rock, the "Mother of the Mic." Sha-Rock grew up in the South Bronx borough of New York City, where rap first emerged. She was a part of the rap group Funky 4 +1, and you're right if you guessed that she was the "plus one." Jazzy Jeff, one part of the rap duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince with Will Smith, was also in the group. They were the first rap group to perform on TV and sign a record deal. Sha-Rock was the only woman in this group.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Most Famous Female Rap Stars, Ranked By How Many Albums They Released</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilopubnnqutc2aoWanpJ2ys3nFnqSapJViv6K8z56prGWnnbxutMSlp56cXai1orzEZp%2BiqF2dvLF7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-zimmer-salary-net-worth-contract-new-wife-teams-coached-age-girlfriend-age-and-record-of.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Zimmer Salary, Net Worth, Contract, New Wife, Teams Coached, Age, Girlfriend Age And Record Of</span></a>
