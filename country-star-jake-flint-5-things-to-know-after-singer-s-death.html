My heart is gone and I just really need him to come back. I can’t take much more. I need him here.”</p><p>Brenda has received an outpouring of love, support and condolences from friends and fans who were left stunned by the “Long Road Back Home” singer’s death. Jake’s <a href=#>social media accounts</a> are filled with comments paying tribute to him.</p><p>The “Cowtown” artist, an Oklahoma native based in Tulsa, grew up on bluegrass and ‘90s jam bands. He was taught to play guitar by his father’s friends after his dad, diagnosed with ALS, asked his pals to teach his son about music, according to <a href=#>Jake’s official biography</a>.</p><p>The late artist was well known in Oklahoma’s Red Dirt scene, a subgenre of country music. He released his sophomore album, a self-titled record, in February 2020. In the aftermath of his death, fans have flocked to <a href=#>his cover of “Hallelujah”</a> by Leonard Cohen.</p><p>“Jake admits that at too young of an age he experienced many of life’s highs and lows including losing his father,” the “Hurry Up & Wait” crooner’s bio states. “He claims he’s floated through life loving, hating, gaining, losing, experimenting, witnessing, missioning, sinning, breaking the law, paying the consequences while openly and candidly writing about it all.”</p><p>The singer was set to play a string of shows around his home state in the coming weeks, including a concert on Friday, December 2 — less than one week after he and Brenda exchanged vows in rural Oklahoma.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We were just about to embark on some business together after he and Brenda got married- which was yesterday. Yes-yesterday,” Jake’s manager, <strong>Brenda Cline</strong>, wrote via <a href=#>Facebook</a> on Monday, November 28 post announcing her client’s death. “Jake has a million friends and I’m not sure how everyone will cope with this tragic loss. We need prayers- it’s all so surreal. Please please pray for his new wife Brenda, Jake’s precious mother, his sister and the rest of his family and friends. This is going to be incredibly difficult for so many. We love you Jake and in our hearts forever. 💔.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about Jake.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksLDBza2psmWjqa6zecmaop5llqG2r8CMbmStoJmjtLR506hkpKafrHqistOeqWarmaO0pr7SZpuemaSdfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angelina-jolie-s-brother-revealed-his-relationship-with-his-sister-changed-after-her-split-from-brad.html><span>←</span><span>Angelina Jolie's Brother Revealed His Relationship With His Sister Changed After Her Split From Brad</span></a>
