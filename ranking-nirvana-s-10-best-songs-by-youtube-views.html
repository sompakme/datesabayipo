This song was first released as a single in 1990, a year before Nirvana put out their most successful album, Nevermind, and it was released under Sub Pop, an independent record label that signed many Seattle bands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later, in 1992, when the band was already a commercial success, it was included in the compilation album Incesticide.

The video is a compilation of different moments of the band's concerts.</p><p>There was some controversy around the release of this song, as there were disagreements between <a href=#>Kurt's widow, Courtney Love</a>, and surviving members Krist Novoselic and <a href=#>Dave Grohl</a>, which ended in a legal fight. Luckily, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was resolved in 2002</a> without needing to go to court, and the song was released in the Nirvana greatest hits album the same year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-apologies---81-million-views><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>All Apologies - 81 Million Views</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nirvana-all-apologies-unplugged-Cropped.jpg><p>All Apologies was the second single from the band's third and last album, In Utero, which came out in 1993. The version that received 81 million <a href=#>views on Youtube</a> is the one from Nirvana's MTV Unplugged concert, and fans love it, but it wouldn't have been Kurt Cobain's choice.</p><p>"I don't think it was the best performance of the Unplugged thing," he said in an interview, and added that he thought they'd "played that song a lot better before," but he agreed that it was a song that worked very well acoustically. The song was performed by Lorde when the band was inducted into the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=about-a-girl---107-million-views><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>About A Girl - 107 Million Views</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nirvana-about-a-girl-unplugged-Cropped.jpg><p>About a Girl is a song from Nirvana's first album, Bleach, from 1989.

The video for this song is a compilation of Nirvana concerts, and it's now used to raise funds for the World Health Organization. This is a very raw and intense song, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kurt Cobain explained how he wrote it.</a></p><p>"The story is about a guy who lost his girlfriend. I can't decide what caused her to die, let's say she died of AIDS or a car accident or something, and he's going around brooding and he turned to religion as a last resort to keep himself alive. To keep him from suicide."

We couldn’t decide between ‘Come as You Are’ and ‘In Bloom.’ Kurt was nervous about ‘Come as You Are’ because it was too similar to a Killing Joke song, but we all thought it was still the better song to go with.

"I can barely, especially on a bad night like tonight, get through Teen Spirit. I literally want to throw my guitar down and walk away. I can’t pretend to have a good time playing it."</p><p>About writing the song, he said: "I was trying to write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it. When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I should have been in that band — or at least in a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Things Most Nirvana Fans Don't Know About The Band</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiloqqmlruiecGeqq1lo6S7qL%2BMsqaurKWXsm7CyJ6urGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jenni-kayne-s-ranch-estate-in-santa-ynez-california-lists-for-6-million.html><span>←</span><span>Jenni Kaynes Ranch Estate In Santa Ynez, California Lists For $6 Million</span></a>
