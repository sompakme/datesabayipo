The pair instantly hit it off while working together on the Discovery+ series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ant-Anstead-Makes-His-Relationship-With-Renee-Zellweger-Instagram-Official.jpg><p>“He’s excited about life and excited in general,” a source told Us Weekly exclusively of the former Wheeler Dealers star in June. “Part of it can be because he’s dating Renée. … You can tell he’s in a good spot in his life — <a href=#>he’s super happy</a>.”</p><p>Anstead was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Christina Haack</strong></a>, with whom he shares <a href=#>23-month-old son Hudson</a>, from December 2018 to September 2020. They <a href=#>finalized their divorce in June</a> weeks before Anstead was spotted <a href=#>packing on the PDA with Zellweger</a> in California.</p><p>Though it’s still early on in their relationship, things between the Judy actress and her new flame are quickly heating up. Earlier this month, <a href=#>the couple attended their first event together</a> at the Lyon Air Museum in Santa Ana, California, dressing up for the Radford Motors Gala. An insider later told Us that the romance is “headed in a positive direction.”</p><p>“They each feel like they’ve finally met their soulmate,” the source added, noting that the <a href=#>Bridget Jones’s Diary</a> star and Anstead are “really cherishing their time together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ant-Anstead-Makes-His-Relationship-With-Renee-Zellweger-Instagram-Official-2.jpg><p>The pair have kept their relationship relatively private, but <a href=#>Anstead couldn’t help but gush over his “magical” girlfriend</a> during a recent appearance on Entertainment Tonight.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Sometimes things come to you at the right time, and actually the right time is often the most unexpected,” he said on Friday, August 20. “There’s absolutely no way it was something I expected, but there’s something magical in that right?”</p><p>The For the Love of Cars presenter added that “it’s a real shame” when exes <a href=#>can’t make coparenting work</a> after a divorce. Along with Hudson, he shares two children, Amelie, 17, and Archi, 14, with ex-wife <strong>Louise Anstead</strong>. The 38-year-old Christina on the Coast star, for her part, <a href=#>shares daughter Taylor, 10, and son Brayden, 6,</a> with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Tarek El Moussa</strong></a>.</p><p>“The concept of blended families is more common now than it was and we live in a society now where it’s more normal. … [And] ultimately when all that, I guess, awkwardness falls away, which it will do eventually, time’s a great healer,” he said on Friday. “You’re only gonna get the opportunity to look back. And when you look back and you say, ‘How did I handle my side? How did I handle my half?’ And, you know, I’m really proud of my half.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapqRirq%2B%2F056YnWWimrumsYyznKWkp5q0pr6MppiknV2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1utc2sq5qfopa6brvFn6CcoZGhfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-the-explosive-real-housewives-drama-that-went-down-at-bravocon-2022.html><span>←</span><span>All The Explosive Real Housewives Drama That Went Down At BravoCon 2022</span></a>
