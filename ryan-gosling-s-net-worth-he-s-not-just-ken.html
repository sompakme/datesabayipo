Due to the nature of his father’s job, Ryan had to move frequently, and his new classmates were typically unwelcoming to "the new kid."</p><p>Ryan himself recounted another violent incident from his school years, one which dissuaded him from returning:</p><p>"I walked into school. Everything got really quiet. I found one of the kids in front of a urinal. I smacked his face into the tile, and he bled.</p><p>"The other kid was at his desk. I picked up a math textbook and made his nose bleed. I didn't want to do it. I don't like violence. I never went back to that school again."</p><p>After he was so often targeted by bullies, people started calling him "Trouble," because he would often fight back against them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a boy, Gosling was not adept at his studies; in fact, he was unable to read, and was evaluated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but never formally diagnosed.</p><p>His only companion was his television, where he watched programs and desired to immerse himself in the world on the screen.</p><p>Gosling admitted:</p><p>I was a lonely child. I didn’t do well at school and TV was my only friend. Then, one day, <a href=#>I saw Raquel Welch</a> on The Muppet Show … She was the first crush I ever had, and I thought, 'How do I get to meet this woman?'</p><p>And then I thought, well, she’s on TV, so to meet her, I have to get on TV myself.</p><p>A twelve-year-old with a dream of meeting his crush auditioned for a new version of The Mickey Mouse Club on the Disney Channel — and secured a two-year contract alongside <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>, <a href=#>Christina Aguilera</a>, and <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a>.</p><p>Gosling moved to the United States with his mother for this opportunity.</p><p>Although he rarely appeared on-screen (because showrunners thought the other kids were more talented), Ryan still recalls the show fondly, as it taught him to focus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the show was canceled in 1995, Gosling moved back to Canada,

to stardom.</p><p>In 1995, after returning to Canada, Gosling secured many one-episode roles on children's shows, such as Are You Afraid Of The Dark, Goosebumps, Road To Avonlea, and Ready Or Not — until he landed a breakout role in the film Frankenstein And Me.</p><p>His first major breakthrough came in 1997, when he was just 17.</p><p>Ryan got the opportunity to work on the teen drama sitcom Breaker High as Sean Hanlon, and he concurrently decided to leave high school to pursue an acting career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The next year, when Breaker High ended, Gosling moved to New Zealand for the television show Young Hercules.</p><p>However, he soon grew bored with the series, and after Young Hercules, he never again took a main role on a television show throughout his career.</p><p>His portrayal of Hercules was quite popular in the United States, and it didn't take him too long to land him a role in a movie.</p><p>His big first movie (with legend <a href=#>Denzel Washington</a>) was a supporting role in Remember The Titans:</p><p>Gosling's standout performance in The Believer, in which he portrayed Danny Balint, a Jewish Neo-Nazi character, earned him significant praise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After impressing audiences in those roles, Ryan landed the biggest role of his career to date in The Notebook in 2004, which is still regarded as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the greatest love stories</a> in cinematic history.</p><p>The Notebook elevated Gosling to worldwide fame, but his 2007 movie Half Nelson marked the first time he was considered a contender for an Oscar.</p><p>Everything was going well in Gosling's career, but his "Trouble" kicked in, and his rising star status was endangered.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:12</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Initially, he agreed to participate in the production — but he was fired from the project, two days before filming began.</p><p>Later, it emerged that Gosling was unhappy about being cast in the role of a father to a teenage girl, as he felt he was too young for the part at the age of just 27.</p><p>However, Jackson and Walsh sought to convince him that he could appear older, with gray hair and theatrical makeup. Without informing the filmmakers, Gosling gained 60 pounds and grew a beard to look like an old man.</p><p>Gosling's efforts did not go over well with Jackson, and at the last minute, they cast <a href=#>Mark Wahlberg</a> to replace him.</p><p>A man who was then-recently nominated for an Oscar (in 2007) was overweight, and he had no acting projects lined up due to his broken commitment to The Lovely Bones.</p><p>After this fiasco, Gosling's career was quiet for three years, and he didn't land any new roles — at first glance, it looked like Ryan's career had met a premature end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:15</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/comeback-king-john-travolta-s-net-worth_site.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Travolta Knows Comebacks</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Comeback King: John Travolta's Net Worth And Many Career Revivals, Explained</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>He never gave up despite many setbacks, and now John Travolta is one of Hollywood’s wealthiest leading men.</span><h2 id=ryan-gosling-hustles-to-the-top><strong>Ryan Gosling Hustles To The Top</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ryan-gosling-in-white-suit.jpg><p>Ryan Gosling had tasted the sweet nectar of success, but then thirsted for three years.</p><p>In 2010, he roared back, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the finest performances of his career</a> in Blue Valentine.</p><p>He didn’t stop there.
