The Philadelphia radio show “Bex and Buster,” which airs on station Q102, announced on Wednesday, November 15, that it won’t be playing any of Swift’s music leading up to the Eagles vs. Kansas City Chiefs game on Monday, November 20.
“Q102 loves Taylor Swift and the whole Travis [Kelce] and Taylor thing as much as the rest of the world, but this weekend we’ve gotta focus, so we’ve been forced to punt Taylor Swift from the playlist,” radio personality Buster Satterfield explained during an appearance on Good Day Philadelphia."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The singer sat next to Travis’ mom, <strong>Donna Kelce</strong>, and was seen walking through the stadium with Travis after the game.</p><p>Since then, Swift’s attendance at Chiefs games has been a major point of discussion within the NFL. Travis <a href=#>weighed in on the league’s attention</a> during an October episode of his “New Heights” podcast.</p><p>“I think it’s fun when they show who was at the game. I think it brings a little bit more to the atmosphere, brings a little bit more to what you’re watching,” he said. “But at the same time, I think … they’re overdoing it a little bit, for sure, especially my situation. [But] I think they’re just trying to have fun with it.”</p><p>Travis took a turn in the stands over the weekend when he attended Swift’s Saturday, November 11, Eras Tour concert in Buenos Aires. During the performance, he was seen chatting with Taylor’s dad, <strong>Scott Swift</strong>, who was <a href=#>wearing a Chiefs lanyard</a>.</p><p>“Got him over to the good side, baby,” Travis joked during Wednesday’s episode of his podcast, telling Jason, 36, that he’s converting the Swifts “one by one” to join the Chiefs fandom.</p><p>In response, Jason appealed to Scott, 71, directly. “You’re gonna let this man’s devilishly good looks and relationship with your daughter sway you from a lifetime of fandom, Scott? Ridiculous.” he quipped.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Travis added that Scott is a “huge football guy” who played the sport in college. “I think he was a linebacker turned center,” he said. “He’s a tall guy.”</p><p>Monday’s Chiefs vs. Eagles game is a rematch of the 2023 Super Bowl, which earned Travis his second championship ring. Q102’s temporary boycott of Swift’s discography will begin at 5 p.m. ET on Friday, November 17, and end on Tuesday, November 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKehoZyhxm6%2BwJ2gqGWjqa61tc6nZJuZnqh6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjJucn6eimnqmrcalnKxlpqh6pLTInp2sZZeWuqZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikki-haley-s-parents-photo-exposed-her-indian-ethnicity.html><span>←</span><span>Nikki Haleys Parents Photo Exposed Her Indian Ethnicity</span></a>
