The pair met in a club in Mexico and were engaged within three months. They <a href=#>tied the knot in June 2018</a>, but called it quits shortly after. He filed for <a href=#>divorce in January 2019</a>.</p><p>“In November, we were fighting daily,” Larissa, 32, told Us Weekly exclusively earlier this month. “So that time, I was really hurt by his behavior and I <a href=#>flushed the ring down the toilet</a>.”</p><p>The relationship made headlines throughout the season and afterward as they each accused each other of physical assault and cheating. The day that he filed for divorce, she was arrested and <a href=#>charged with first-degree domestic battery</a>. It was her third arrest.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Larissa also told Us that <a href=#>she “regrets” doing the series</a>. “If I could go back in time, I would never do the show … I think the show accelerated all the drama, especially with his mother too,” she said on March 3. Colt had a different opinion: “I learned a lot, and I had a lot of fun. And the problems we had were not because of the show. We had our worst arguments when the cameras were not rolling.”</p><p>Scroll through our gallery to see the rest of the cast.
