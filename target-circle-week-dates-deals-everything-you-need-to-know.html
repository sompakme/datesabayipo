There are sitewide sales across many categories like food, fashion, home and beyond.</p><h2><strong>When is Target Circle Week?</strong></h2><p>Target Circle Week will take place from July 7-13 starting at 3:00 am EST.</p><h2><strong>Do I Need to Be a Target Circle Member?</strong></h2><p>Yes! Although Target is known for offering its customers deals and savings all the time, being a Target Circle member opens you up to acquiring even more discounts and deals (and racking up rewards). It’s the only way to get the savings and deals of Target Circle Week. With your Target Circle membership, you get access to deals automatically applied at checkout, can earn Target Circle rewards and get personalized deals. You can also redeem free trials and links to other rewards programs and help Target decide where to give back to the community!</p><h2><strong>How Do I Become a Target Circle Member?</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">You can sign up for a Target Circle here</a>. It’s free! You can also upgrade with a paid Target Circle 360 membership for just $49 for the first year (regularly $99). This will help give you a head start on saving some dough! The Target Circle program gives you access to benefits like unlimited same-day delivery with Shipt with no delivery fees on orders over $35, free two-day shipping and no-rush returns.</p><h2><strong>What Is on Sale During Target Circle Week?</strong></h2><p>During Target Circle Week, you can expect to see deals such as up to 50% off toy brands including Lego, Monster Jam and LOL Surprise, up to 40% off kitchen and floorcare including Keurig, KitchenAid, Ninja, Dyson, Shark and Bissell, up to 30% off bedding and bath including Casaluna and Threshold and much more!</p><p>Don’t want to miss the top 2024 deals?

For instance, if you have the Target app, the Circle Bonus notification will suggest deals and sales happening currently that align with your interests and shopping habits.</p><p>Target suggests checking the app daily for new exclusive deals of the day.
