Born in London, Ontario, in 1994, Justin Bieber was brought up primarily by his maternal grandparents when he was born to a young, unmarried mother. <a href=#>Bieber grew up mastering the art</a> of playing various musical instruments like guitar, piano, drums, and trumpet. He gave his debut performance at a singing competition at the age of 12.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His mother posted a video of his 2007 performance at this competition, and record executive Scooter Braun accidentally chanced upon it. He was so impressed by it that Bieber was asked to come to Atlanta immediately to record some demo tapes. Soon enough, Bieber was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">signed under R&B star Usher</a><a href=#>,</a> his debut album came out in 2010, and the rest is history.</p><h2 id=my-world>My World</h2><p>The debut album of Justin Bieber was released in 2009 by Island, RBMG, and Schoolboy Records and was called ‘My World EP’.

The album is estimated to have sold over 3.37 million copies.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Justin Bieber Will Make Thousands For Upcoming 'Friends' Reunion Cameo</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bieber’s debut studio album had the iconic single ‘Baby’, which also became one of the most-watched videos on YouTube, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chart Masters</a>. There is much consensus that says this was one of the best-selling albums of Justin Bieber, and it also had some other hits like ‘Somebody To Love’ and ‘Eenie Meenie.’</p><h2 id=under-the-mistletoe>Under the Mistletoe</h2><p>‘Under The Mistletoe’ was Bieber's second studio album and his first Christmas album, recorded and released in 2011. This album was about 37 minutes long, and according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>, it became an instant fan favorite, selling over 210,000 copies in its debut week itself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the best songs from this album were ‘Mistletoe’ and ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You’, which was <a href=#>Justin Bieber’s</a> rendition of the original by Mariah Carey. This album made it to the number 1 spot in both the USA and Canada and sold over 1.55 million copies.</p><h2 id=believe>Believe</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox Business</a>, the album ‘Believe’ has sold over 1.66 million copies to date and was also ranked as number 1 on the billboard. This was the fourth consecutive Billboard achievement for Bieber’s.</p><p>Believe, released in 2011-12, was the third studio album by the Canadian singer-songwriter. Particularly unforgettable was the single ‘Boyfriend’ from this album. The track became so famous that it sold over 3 million copies in international sales besides making it number one on the ‘Billboard Hot 100’. Furthermore, it went to platinum six times which led to Bieber’s historical tour around the globe in 2012 and ’13 for its promotion. In the process, Justin earned a significant amount of $109 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=never-say-never-the-remixes>Never Say Never: The Remixes</h2><p>Never Say Never: The Remixes was reportedly the second remix album by Justin Bieber, and it came out in 2011. The performance was a tie-up with the upcoming movie ‘Never Say Never’ in 2011 itself.</p><p>Famous pop stars like <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> and Kanye West are featured in this album to add to the charm. For example, the remix ‘Runaway Love’ was particularly well-known, which was the Canadian popstar’s collaboration with the famous rapper Kanye West.

Moreover, it made an instant record of being Bieber’s highest-selling album within a week itself, with about 522,000 copies selling in a swoop.</p><p>What made this album so special was the critical acclaim it gained right after its release. The singles ‘Sorry’, ‘What Do U Mean?’, and ‘Love Yourself’ became the daily jams of the youth. However, the song ‘Where Are U Now’, which was Bieber’s collaboration with DJs Skrillex and Diplo, won the Grammy for its phenomenal dance performance.</p><h2 id=changes>Changes</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>‘Changes’ was the fifth studio album<a href=#> by the Canadian</a> musician.

It sold over 126,000 copies in the first week itself.</p><p>Several experts criticized the album by lashing at Justin Bieber for not branching out to try new music niches. The commercial success of this album spoke for itself, and Bieber held his status of being a legendary Rockstar.</p><p>Justin Bieber just dropped his sixth studio album in March 2021 by the name of ‘Justice’. The album was recorded for two years, from 2019 to 2021, and was released by the RBMG/Def Jam record label.
