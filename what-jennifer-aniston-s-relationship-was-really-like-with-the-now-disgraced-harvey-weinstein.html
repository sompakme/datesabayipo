We'll discuss what their relationship was like and how <a href=#>Aniston managed to hold her own</a>, even when they were working on a film together.</p><p>These days, Jen is telling her story and serving as a big inspiration for others.</p><h2 id=the-two-only-worked-on-one-film-together>The Two Only Worked On One Film Together</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully for Aniston, she only worked on one film with Harvey Weinstein's name attached to the project. It was a different type of role for Jen, in the thriller and drama category, 'Derailed'.</p><p>The film was not a success, bringing in $57 million at the box office, off a $22 million budget. Jen starred alongside Clive Owens in the film.</p><p>Despite the reviews and the fact that Weinstein was linked to the project, Aniston had good memories from her time on-set. <a href=#>She recalls being comfortable working alongside the film's director</a>, Mikael Håfström, despite his different approach.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Seth MacFarlane Accurately Predicted Harvey Weinstein's Downfall</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"For me, this was such unchartered territory. I felt such a trust in everything he said. There was never a debate, never questioning. That's really important. And having seen Evil and meeting him and talking about his take on how he wanted to play this, it was intriguing, because it's an uncomfortable reality. There is a lot of discomfort watching this movie. Put in the wrong hands, it could have gone from that high concept glossy slick thriller and it's not, far from it."</p><p>"Thank God for directors like him who think that it was interesting for him to take this persona and put it in that part. I really appreciate that."</p><p>However, her experience was not the same alongside Harvey Weinstein. According to Jen, they had met a few times and in both instances, their time together was not positive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jen-39-s-experience-was-not-a-good-one>Jen's Experience Was Not A Good One</h2><p>Jen recalls encountering Harvey for the first time and of course, things did not go well. It was at the premiere dinner for the film. According to Jen alongside Variety, <a href=#>Harvey rudely told the person sitting next to her to get up</a>, she recalls the experience.</p><p>"I had to. There was the premiere dinner. I remember I was sitting at the dinner table with Clive, and our producers and a friend of mine was sitting with me. And he literally came to the table and said to my friend: “Get up!” And I was like, “Oh my gosh.” And so my friend got up and moved and Harvey sat down. It was just such a level of gross entitlement and piggish behavior."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Harvey Weinstein Manipulated Hollywood Into Giving Him An Oscar</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things would only get worse between the two when Harvey demanded Jen wore his ex-wife's clothing to the premiere. After browsing through selections, Jen made it clear she had no interest. Aniston made mention that Harvey knew better not to pick a fight over the actress on the matter, though one has to believe he was very displeased, given he flew all the way to London to give her the news.</p><p>Harvey's anger would only amplify towards Aniston, as he would take things to a disturbing level.</p><h2 id=weinstein-was-furious-over-aniston-39-s-allegations>Weinstein Was Furious Over Aniston's Allegations</h2><p>Alongside The Enquirer, it was said that a rep of Aniston's sent out an email, claiming that she was assaulted by Weinstein during the filming of 'Derailed'. It is said that Jen was uncomfortable around Harvey and it is believed that the filmmaker had an obsession with the star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Turns out, <a href=#>Harvey was none too pleased with these allegations</a>. So much so that he stated, "Jen Aniston should be killed." Yup, a dark mind indeed.</p><p>These days, Jen is doing her very best to promote equality, on shows like 'The Morning Show', which continues to tackle problems that are taking place in the world of Hollywood.</p><p>As for Harvey, well, it seems like his reputation seems to worsen as the days move along.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Here's What Harvey Weinstein's Daughters Are Doing Now</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYremus2inZ6qXZa7qr%2FTqKWsZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq4rdJmqZ6ZnKHGbrjIpJxmr5mptW60wKutnrFdrLKqutKtnKKmXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./perdita-weeks-net-worth-how-much-is-weeks-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Perdita Weeks Net Worth How Much is Weeks Worth?</span></a>
