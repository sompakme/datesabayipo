The NAMA also provided a biography for James upon releasing the announcement:</p><p>ABOUT THE HONOREE</p><p dir=ltr>WWE® Superstar &nbsp;MICKIE JAMES™ or Mickie Laree James (Powhatan) is internationally recognized in&nbsp;the world of professional wrestling. As a SMG Recording Artist, with two full length albums and two singles&nbsp;to her credit, she is also&nbsp;widely known&nbsp;in the country music circuit. Mickie, who is of Powhatan&nbsp;heritage from her maternal side, grew up in Virginia as&nbsp;a tomboy who loved riding horses, playing violin and dreamed of being in the wrestling&nbsp;ring performing for fans all over the world. By&nbsp;2002, Mickie’s dream was realized when she debuted on the national stage for Total Nonstop Action (TNA) and signed a developmental deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) that following year. She made her on screen debut for WWE in 2005 and would go on to win her first Women’s Championship at WrestleMania 22 after a very memorable feud with Trish Stratus. She captured the Women’s Title five&nbsp;times and the Divas Title once for a total of six championships in the WWE. Mickie had achieved her&nbsp;goals&nbsp;which were&nbsp;to become the first woman to win WWE’s Women’s & Divas titles as well as TNA’s Knockouts Title. Not only did she do just that but she also went on to win TNA’s Knockouts Title three times. She has set a precedent and broken many barriers for women in the WWE.</p><p>Mickie has always had a passion for music and singing as well. While on the road with WWE, she would travel to Nashville on her days off to meet with producers, songwriters and vocal coaches to pursue her dream of recording a country music album. By the spring of 2010, Mickie released her first album entitled,&nbsp;Strangers and Angels.&nbsp;The first single released off the album was&nbsp;a fast paced, exciting track called “Are You With Me?” and the album featured Mickie’s incredible vocal range in her self-assured powerful&nbsp;manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2013, Mickie released her second album entitled,&nbsp;Somebody’s Gonna Pay&nbsp;through Entertainment One Music&nbsp;which debuted at #15 on Billboard’s Heatseekers charts. The album also featured&nbsp;the&nbsp;bonus track, “Hardcore Country,”&nbsp;which&nbsp;became Mickie’s&nbsp;TNA entrance song.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mickie also personally penned&nbsp;three of the songs off the album; “Best Damn Night,” “80 Proof” and the cover track, “Somebody’s Gonna Pay”&nbsp;in which&nbsp;the music video&nbsp;co-starred fellow professional wrestlers Trish Stratus and Magnus&nbsp;(Mickie’s&nbsp;husband Nick Aldis).&nbsp; Mickie released a new single in November of last year, “Shooting Blanks” which has been nominated by the Native American Music Awards for&nbsp;Song of the Year. She has also just released her second single, “Get Down” which is impacting country radio now and can be purchased through iTunes, Amazon and other online digital retailers.</p><p>Mickie’s recordings have been embraced by the Country music community and have&nbsp;received positive reviews from publications such as;&nbsp;Country Weekly&nbsp;and&nbsp;CMA Magazine.&nbsp;She has&nbsp;performed in concerts throughout the world and has&nbsp;shared the stage with other country artists such as;&nbsp;Rascal Flatts, Montgomery Gentry, Gretchen Wilson and Randy Houser. Mickie has served as an incredible inspiration and role model for many artists as well as Native youth from across the country. &nbsp;Her world renowned reputation as a WWE Superstar, professional wrestler, country singer and entertainer undoubtedly warrants her place of prominence as an outstanding individual and honoree. The Native American Music Awards & Association&nbsp;is proud to honor Mickie James, and induct her into the N.A.M.A. Hall of Fame.&nbsp; Mickie will also be performing live at the Awards ceremony.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwhJdwbHBpXaK2pLfInmSjmZ2awG7AzmaZnmWZo7G2r9Oem2ahnqm8brrAraCvnV2Wuqa%2ByJyYp2WdqsCqr4yarpqqlKh6qa3LpWSonl2brq6x</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-paul-reynolds-biography-age-height-net-worth-girlfriend.html><span>←</span><span>John Paul Reynolds Biography: Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend</span></a>
