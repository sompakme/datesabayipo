When most people hear the word "director," they still think of men. This harmful stereotype comes from so many men getting chosen to direct huge Hollywood movies and almost always being the ones on stage at award shows. Some things have changed in the past decade, but not nearly enough. More female directors are started to be recognized for their hard work, but if you watch the award shows, it's pretty much the same people who are there every year.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Cast Of 'Fuller House,' Ranked By Net Worth</h2><time>Sep 2, 2024</time>

Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel are the last two actors that fans probably expect to see in a movie together these days. But that’s exactly what just happened.
