The Miami Vice actor separated from the Working Girl star in 1994 before reconciling only to separate again in 1995. Their divorce was finalized in 1996, and Griffith went on to marry <a href=#><strong>Antonio Banderas</strong></a> later that year (they divorced in 2017).</p><p>Though Dakota is the former couple’s only child together, she has half-siblings on both sides of her family. Griffith gave birth to son Alexander, 36, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Steven Bauer</strong></a>. She also welcomed daughter Stella, 26, with Banderas. Don, meanwhile, shares son <strong>Jesse Johnson</strong>, 39, with ex <strong>Patti D’Arbanville</strong>. He welcomed kids Grace, 22, Jasper, 20, and Deacon, 16, with <strong>Kelley Phleger</strong>, who he has been married to since 1999.</p><p>“We were all cool [with each other]. Obviously, there were times where it was not cool, but I experienced that, so I don’t want that in my life,” the Fifty Shades of Grey actress told VF of how her childhood affected her current relationships.</p><p>She added, “My life is incredibly lucky and privileged, and the life I led growing up was remarkable — the places I went and how we lived and what we were able to experience. But we also struggled with internal family dynamics and situations and events that are so traumatic.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That upbringing has made her conscious of not only relationships with ex spouses and children but also keeping her private life very low-key. She and the Coldplay singer, 45, first got together in 2017, less than two years after his divorce from Paltrow was finalized. Martin remains close with his ex-wife, with whom he shares daughter Apple, 18, and son Moses, 16. The TeaTime Productions founder said she wants to maintain positive relationships for the teenagers.</p><p>“I don’t want any kids to experience anything like that,” Dakota said referring to her own family dynamic. “It’s better to be kind, and it’s also really nice that everybody actually really loves each other and has each other’s backs.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Goop founder</a>, 49, has previously spoken out about her friendship with the Lost Daughter star. “I love her,” Paltrow told <a href=#>Harper’s Bazaar</a> in January 2020. “I can see how it would seem weird because it’s sort of unconventional. But I think, in this case, just having passed through it iteratively, I just adore her. I always start to think of the ampersand sign — what else can you bring in, instead of being resistant to or being made insecure by? There’s so much juice in leaning in to something like that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZukwaJ5yaifp6ufo3qwuoygrrKmlam1brzApaurp6dis7O1xKebrKCZpXqjsdOtnKtlpKR6o7GMpKCnnF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bts-j-hope-and-j-cole-s-song-on-the-street-has-new-lyrics-that-you-can-listen-to.html><span>←</span><span>BTS J-Hope And J.
