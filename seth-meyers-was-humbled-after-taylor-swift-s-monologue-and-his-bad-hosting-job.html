In this role, he worked with many different celebrities, including the infamous Taylor Swift. When it came time for Swift to host the network program, she threw a curveball at the writing staff, which included Meyers and the show's producer.</p><p>In an interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Meyers detailed how 19-year-old Taylor Swift came into her first day as host</a> and announced that she had already prepared her monologue, which she presented in song form.

However, since he has stepped away and returned to occupy the host role, he sees things differently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When he sat in the writing chair, he didn't understand the pressure the hosts were under and how little guidance they received before going up on stage. As he filled in for the host position, this was more of a reality than ever.</p><p>Even with years of experience on the show, he still found himself lost in what to do. The late-night talk show host reports that the newfound understanding makes him even more impressed with how Taylor Swift performed in her role at just 19 years old.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnqyYYrqmxcSrqmagpaKvrbHDZquasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWjo7luuc6npqWnl6qycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kristi-branim-fox-megan-fox-s-sister-age-wiki-bio-husband-and-net-wort.html><span>←</span><span>Kristi Branim Fox (Megan Foxs Sister) Age, Wiki, Bio, Husband, and Net Wort</span></a>
