I was stunned. But what took me over the edge was the bridge. I believe the trajectory of my life changed at that moment. It’s a high chance my addiction of putting bridges on everything was cemented because of this song. I’ve subconsciously been trying to chase that high for 20 years.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As Tyler’s tribute continued, he began to speak about the music video’s aesthetic brilliance. He remembered seeing the visuals on&nbsp;Cita’s World, where his love and interest for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“minimalist” design was piqued</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I caught the video on&nbsp;Cita’s World&nbsp;after school. I was stunned, but this time my eyes [were] recording information that would, again, change the trajectory of my life.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“On top of that, this was on BET, which felt like a curve ball compared to the other videos that AJ and Free were introducing. No one knew images like that would be shaping how things are 20 years later,” he proclaimed. “I’ve stated this multiple times, but “Frontin'” is my favorite piece of art to grace this earth. I am forever grateful that I’m alive at the same time to experience it. I can only hope that one day something else crosses my path and makes me feel exactly how this does.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6nGrbHRZquhnV2Yv6at06ipZqqVq7KiuNJmp6GZoqeyrbiMn6mopqSeu26vx5qloJ2UYrmqssRmaGtrZGyDdH6Sa2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nate-landwehr-age-height-wiki-biography-girlfriend-next-fight.html><span>←</span><span>Nate Landwehr Age, Height, Wiki, Biography, Girlfriend, Next Fight</span></a>
