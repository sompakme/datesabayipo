The Bridesmaids actress, 42, decided to style a pair of platform heels to deliver her opening monologue Saturday, April 7, but forgot to practice walking in them first.</p><p>McCarthy wobbled her way onto the stage and used a chair to help balance, but she ended up falling on the floor as part of the funny sketch. The Identity Thief star then performed a song and dance number with <strong>Taran Killam</strong> on her knees.</p><p>After getting back on her feet, she explained to the audience, “They told me, ‘Make sure you practice in your shoes.’ I said, ‘What, I live in heels!’ But I don’t do that. That was not honest. I’m primarily in a Croc.”</p><p>“I just really wanted to get all gussied up for you guys,” she said. “Wow, I can’t feel anything from my arch to my toes,” she joked. “You could just bite that half off.”</p><p>With her quads “seizing up,” McCarthy fell off stage and kicked off the show from the floor.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The actress went on to spoof Rutgers basketball coach <strong>Mike Rice</strong>, who was fired after video surfaced of him abusing players. McCarthy played Sheila Kelly, the coach of Middle Delaware State, who would throw toasters at players because they’re “toast.”</p><p>Also on the show, Game of Thrones actor<strong> Peter Dinklage</strong> made an appearance during Weekend Update. The 43-year-old star played the brother of <strong>Bobby Moynihan</strong>‘s drunk uncle character, named Peter Drunklage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Watch McCarthy’s opening monologue in the video above and tell <strong>Us</strong>: What was your favorite sketch?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSepJmowKJ5zJyamqqkncZutM6sq6xlo5bBtr7DmrBmppmctbV5y6KtnmWWlrmtv4yipWagmZy1brTEnqOsZZSqv6q6xmamqZ2enruoecyopaikn5zCpnmRaWhsb2Rk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harlan-coben-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Harlan Coben Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
