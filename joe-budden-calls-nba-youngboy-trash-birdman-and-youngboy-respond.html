He is really, really, really, really, really bad.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ice, a fellow member of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Joe Budden Podcast</a>, delved deeper into the topic by discussing the frequency of his music releases. “I think whatever [record] deal he made or whatever is requiring him to put out music at such a high clip because his stuff is all views,” Ice said. “It usually don’t even translate the streams that way. It’s like YouTube views and s**t like that so he has to constantly, constantly, constantly, constantly [feed the beast].”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Joe Budden wasn’t too interested in the explanation and continued to state how bad NBA YoungBoy’s music is. Naturally, as it often happens with the “Pump It Up” rapper’s critiques, the clip went viral and the “Nevada” artist became aware of Budden’s feelings. “Don’t speak on me,” YoungBoy said in an Instagram story. “I don’t play that sh*t. Don’t rat on me neither, you pu**y bi**h.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He went on to speak on the former Everyday Struggle host’s genitals and how he struggles to get aroused before inviting him to speak in person. “Bi**h, you do all them interviews, come on to Gravedigger Mountain and talk to me, ni**a,” he said. “Bi**h, if you can’t do that, mayne, hey, you bi**h-made ni**a. Shut your f**kin’ mouth!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Birdman echoed YoungBoy’s sentiment, seemingly threatening the polarizing podcast host. “@joebudden you f**kin with something you should leave alone,” the Cash Money founder wrote in an Instagram story. “Stunna Corleone Gotti Nbarg.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This follows Joe Budden’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>back-and-forth</a> with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Drake</a> in October. Budden was admittedly a fan of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>For All The Dogs</a>, but questioned why The 6 God was still spending time with women in their 20s as he is pushing 40 years old.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Toronto rapper <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>fired back</a> on the deluxe edition of the album, rapping, “Imagine us getting our validation from an ex-musician searching for recognition/ Same story every time, they heckle in repetition/ I’m top of the mountain, these ni**as still down at base camp, they planning they expedition” on “Stories About My Brother.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2B8pnnBrpudnZ5iu6OtjLKmrqaXl7y6edOrmKygXZe2s7DMmqVmqpWovbC6w2Zoa2tkbX93g5ZrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-big-freedia-a-boy-or-girl-is-she-transgender.html><span>←</span><span>Is Big Freedia A Boy Or Girl: Is She Transgender?</span></a>
