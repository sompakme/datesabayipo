She claims her contract entitled her to compensation should the payment be late.</p><p>Sasha completed another photoshoot for the company in August 2020, but didn’t receive payment by the deadline for a second time. In total, she's seeking $1200,000 from Kylie Cosmetics.</p><p>Kylie’s team has already responded to the allegations to deny them. They allege Sasha was paid within the deadline stipulated in the original contract and that they have documentation to corroborate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources tell TMZ that Kylie believes the model’s management may have withheld payment from her, though that would be an issue between them, not involving her makeup business.</p><p>Following the 2020 photoshoots, Sasha appeared to believe she was on good terms with Kylie’s company. The insider added that not only did Sasha attempt to get more work from the brand, but she also requested a letter of recommendation, which they didn’t provide.</p><p>This certainly isn’t the first time <a href=#>Kylie and one of her businesses has been hit by a lawsuit</a> . One of her first lawsuit was in 2015 when her and Kendall Jenner’s collaboration was sued for trademark infringement.</p><p>Kylie Cosmetics has also been accused of stealing artwork for advertising purposes.
