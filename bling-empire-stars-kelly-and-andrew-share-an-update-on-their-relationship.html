Turns out, the couple took a six-month break after filming the series to work on themselves. They're together now, but their journey wasn't an easy one.</p><p>"I definitely see where the audience was coming from," Kelly said, referring to the online&nbsp;comments about Andrew's anger issues.&nbsp;"They saw a period, a really dark period of our relationship. And with Andrew's behavior, I don't excuse it at all, and I think it's a 100% wrong."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andrew defended&nbsp;his actions too, and shared his journey through a strange&nbsp;anecdote about being a plant...which is totally his style. In conclusion, he said&nbsp;that he'd grown stronger since his meltdown in Paris and learned a lot on the way.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Critics Choice Awards Nods Are In And Two Netflix Shows Are Leading The Way</a></span></p><p>Kelly shared that the couple went to therapy individually, and Andrew had been able to resolve issues that were "open like a wound."</p><p>The couple confessed&nbsp;that they're back together, and&nbsp;are&nbsp;"stronger, happier" than they had&nbsp;been before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kevin Kreider, the crazy but not-so-rich star on the show, who had the biggest crush on Kelly and the worst opinion of Andrew, seems to have changed his perspective about their relationship too.</p><p>"People change. And people forget that he will&nbsp;change too. He will learn from all of this stuff," said Kevin.</p><p>At 8 episodes, the reality television series is Netflix's&nbsp;easiest&nbsp;binge-watch and provides a glimpse into the wildly fancy&nbsp;world of wealthy Asians living in the City of Angels.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Magic And Mayhem Top The List Of January 2021's New Netflix Lineup</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZpaGenHqmuc%2BiqZ5lo6mus7%2BMpJylpKlirq%2BwjJqlnaqVrHq0tMCrnGaZnmLCsbDArZxmp55iwamxyKtkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexey-pajitnov-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Alexey Pajitnov Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
