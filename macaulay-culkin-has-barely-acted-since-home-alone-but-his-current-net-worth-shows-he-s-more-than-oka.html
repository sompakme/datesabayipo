This article will delve into Macaulay Culkin's net worth, his spending habits, and what he currently does.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-macaulay-culkin-39-s-net-worth-today>How Much Is Macaulay Culkin's Net Worth Today?</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Macaulay Culkin currently has a cool net worth of $18 million.</strong></a> This net worth most likely came about as a result of the wealth Culkin had acquired after amassing a great fortune during his peak days as a child actor. Culkin confessed to Ellen De Generes in 2018 that he never knew how much wealth he had amassed from acting till he turned 18 and was granted access to it. He said:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I didn't see it until I turned 18, I call it the 'Slip of Paper' meeting, where they pretty much put a number on a piece of paper and slide it across the table and then—boom! There you go, so I felt like some kid worked really, really hard, and I inherited all of his money pretty much.</p><p><strong>Macaulay Culkin's debut on the big screen was in 1989's Uncle Buck</strong>, for which he received $40,000. However, it was his iconic portrayal of Kevin McCallister in the 1990 blockbuster Home Alone that catapulted him to stardom.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/michael-richards-hasn-t-acted-in-years-but-his-current-yearly-salary-ensures-he-s-more-than-okay-front-deposit-back-commons-licenses.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Michael Richards Hasn't Acted In Years But His Current Yearly Salary Ensures He's More Than Okay</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Starring in Seinfeld has significantly influenced Michael Richards' life, even though he hasn't appeared on screens for quite some time.</span><p>Despite the film's immense success, <strong>Culkin was initially paid $100,000 for his role</strong>, a modest sum considering its impact. Nevertheless, his reprisal of the character in the 1992 sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, proved more lucrative, <a href=#><strong>earning him approximately $4.5 million</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/macaulay-culkin-and-his-parents-were-sued-after-a-fire-turned-into-a-deadly-tragedy-instar.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following his breakout in Home Alone, Culkin became a sought-after child actor, securing various roles from 1990 to 1994 that significantly boosted his earnings. <strong>He received $1 million for his role in 1991's My Girl</strong>, $1.5 million for the 1993 thriller The Good Son, and a hefty $8 million for each of his roles in 1994's Richie Rich and Getting Even with Dad.</p><p>Collectively, these projects amounted to a substantial $23.5 million during Culkin's peak years as a child star, a considerable fortune at the time. <a href=#>Despite not receiving any royalties from Home Alone</a>, Culkin has demonstrated prudent financial management, ensuring that his earnings from the film and subsequent projects sustain his livelihood.</p><p>In 2018, <strong>Macaulay Culkin was paid a whopping $1 million by Google</strong> for featuring in a Google Assistance advert where he recreated part of his role as Kevin, in Home Alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-macaulay-culkin-spends-his-net-worth>How Macaulay Culkin Spends His Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Macaulay Culkin spends his wealth mostly on real estate</strong>. In the early 2000s, Culkin made some wise real estate investments that met his desire for a good life as well as played a significant role in boosting his net worth.
