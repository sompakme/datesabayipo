It was near disrepair, with caution tape across the sinks and toilets and animals living inside,” says Kayne, who nevertheless could see the potential of the space as a showcase for her Jenni Kayne Home collection and as a place for friends and family to visit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/JenniKayne_SY4.jpg><p>“I took the property down to the studs with my team, opening up rooms, rebuilding and fulfilling its potential.” Renovation of the property took two years and was completed this past March.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/JenniKayne_SY5.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now Kayne is selling the 20-acre property, which the designer has dubbed the Jenni Kayne Ranch and which she describes as a classic “California ranch-style home optimized for indoor-outdoor living.”</p><p>The home slash marketing concept — which she showcases on her brand’s website with a “shop the ranch” buying feature of showcased items including her Pacific Bed and Brentwood Chair — is a study in comfy yet minimalist living done in white and beige tones. “We loved having the ability to showcase the power of our home collection in a living, breathing space,” says the L.A.-based designer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/JenniKayne_SY6.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Listed with Kayne’s husband, Westside Estate Agency partner Richard Ehrlich, for $5.99 million, the open-floor-plan house, which has 360 degrees views of the surrounding oak-dotted hills, includes a chef’s kitchen by bespoke kitchen designer Plain English and a pool surrounded by items from her outdoor furniture line, the Vista Collection.furniture line, the Vista Collection.</p><p>Over the summer and early fall, Kayne and her brand hosted experiential getaway weekends for guests at the property that included farm-to-table meals, wine tastings, yoga classes and spa treatments.

The designer, who last year launched a beauty line, Oak Essentials, is also partnering with the soon-to-open Auberge Resorts Collection property The Inn at Mattei’s Tavern. Located in Los Olivos in the Santa Ynez Valley, the resort will include her beauty line, plus spa treatments curated by Kayne.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Kanye West's College Professor Express His Thoughts About Anti-Semitic Controversy</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmajnZ6jtm63wLKlnqtdp66vr8dmnKyskamybrXNZqqapqSWerq6xLNknJmcnrOwvs2imGakmajBtHnFqKlmbl2itq24yKilaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-nhl-winger-kirill-kaprizov-girlfriend-and-dating-life-in-2022.html><span>←</span><span>Inside NHL Winger Kirill Kaprizov Girlfriend And Dating Life In 2022</span></a>
