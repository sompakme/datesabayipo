Her cohost <strong>Hoda Kotb</strong> revealed the reason behind her exit, telling viewers, “Savannah left a little early today to get her weekend started.”</p><p>Guthrie’s absence comes days after she enjoyed a long weekend by <a href=#>skipping</a> the Monday, April 22, episode of Today. Third hour cohost <strong>Sheinelle Jones</strong>, who was also missing from Friday’s episode, stepped in for the TV personality, who Kotb, 59, said was “taking some time off today.”</p><p>Monday’s episode also marked the return of <strong>Craig Melvin</strong>, who took the previous week off. Third hour cohost <strong>Dylan Dreyer</strong> also did not appear on the episode but returned the following day with Guthrie.</p><p>Guthrie did not address the reason for the break at the time, though she did tease the reason for her absence via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> by sharing photos of her husband, <strong>Michael Feldman</strong>, and their 7-year-old son, Charley, enjoying a Philadelphia 76ers NBA playoff game against the New York Knicks. (Guthrie and Feldman, 55, also share daughter Vale, 9.)</p><p>“Best lives lived – thank you @nba!! go @sixers!” Guthrie captioned pictures of the sports outing on April 20.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Today-Host-Savannah-Guthrie-Exits-NBC-Morning-Show-Early-After-Recent-Time-Off-3.jpg><p>Ahead of Friday’s show, Guthrie enjoyed spending time with several adorable kids on Today. During the show’s Wednesday, April 24, episode, she was spotted holding the child of Today producer <strong>Carter McKay</strong>.</p><p>“Me + Oliver ❤️,” Guthrie captioned <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> snaps of herself and her coworker’s child throughout the day’s episode. “Thank you for letting me hold/steal your adorable baby @cartermckay and Brian.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The following day, several of her fellow Today hosts brought their children to New York City’s 30 Rockefeller Plaza for <a href=#>Take Your Kids to Work Day</a>. “We’ve got so many great kids, kids of our crew, our producers, on-air correspondents,” Guthrie stated on Thursday, April 25, while greeting the group of kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Today-Host-Savannah-Guthrie-Exits-NBC-Morning-Show-Early-After-Recent-Time-Off-2.jpg><p>While Guthrie’s children did not join in on the festivities, Kotb brought along her <a href=#>daughters</a>, Haley, 7, and Hope, 4, while Melvin, 44, was all smiles on the Plaza with his 10-year-old son, Delano. Dreyer, 42, also enjoyed the day with her eldest son, Calvin, 7. (Melvin and his wife, <strong>Lindsay Czarniak</strong>, also share daughter Sybil, 7, while Dreyer and her husband, <strong>Brian Fichera</strong>, are also parents to <a href=#>sons</a> Oliver, 4, and Rusty, 2.)</p><p>Guthrie and her son joined her Today colleagues and their children earlier this month to watch the <a href=#>total solar eclipse</a> at NYC’s American Museum of Natural History. “Total eclipse of my heart ❤️,” Guthrie captioned a sweet <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> photo of Charley sporting a pair of eclipse viewing glasses on April 8.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6hsV2pvKWt2GafqKukYsCiwsCnpZqgXZzCtbTRopxmpJWbwW66wZxkpqeio7avs4ysn6ivXZqus7jYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-bonnie-somerville-dating-bonnie-somerville-boyfriend-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Bonnie Somerville dating?
