Parents say the children should not have been forced to stay on the bus for more than 30 minutes.</p><p>They feel that the school district took too long to get back to them, and they no longer feel safe sending their kids on the bus.</p><p>School officials say the incident is still being reviewed, but students told their parents the bus driver stopped the bus because a student used her cell phone to call her parent after being told not to.</p><p>According to the Mississippi Department of Education Transportation handbook, students cannot use cellphones on the bus.&nbsp;</p><p>However, parents feel that the punishment did not fit the crime and that the bus driver should have reported the student’s misconduct to the school principal instead of stopping the bus and causing distress among the children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The stance of the school</h2><p>FOX13 contacted DeSoto County Schools for comment, and the district provided the following statement in response:</p><p><strong>“As per established district procedure, the bus driver is currently on administrative leave while the matter undergoes a thorough review. It’s important to note that the driver in question was a substitute specifically designated for that particular route. In our commitment to ensuring the safety of our students, we have promptly assigned a new driver to cover the bus route for the duration of the school year.”</strong></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCwxKymraddmLy2utOyZJuto2Kxs7XVnqlmrpmZsrB7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./big-e-has-been-told-by-doctors-his-neck-will-have-a-complete-recovery.html><span>←</span><span>Big E Has Been Told By Doctors His Neck Will Have A Complete Recovery</span></a>
