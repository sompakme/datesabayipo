In August, he held a back-to-school block party in Harlem where students were given free book bags, school supplies, sneakers, clothes, and laptops, among other things.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Jim Jones’ charitable efforts went beyond his local neighborhood as well. Earlier this month, he encouraged <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nike</a> to use their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nike Refurbished program</a> to reward good students and incentivize others to do well in school and beyond.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Nike need to have a give-back program every month for students who excel well in academics and athletics,” he said during an appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Complex’s Full Size Run</a>. “Give them a chance to get some free sneakers. Nikes cost a lot of money, and these kids been supporting Nike for so many years. Why refurbish a pair of sneakers and sell them to somebody for cheaper when you got enough means to give these kids back some free Airs?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Musically, Jones has been on a slight break. His last release was June’s “FaceTime” featuring Capella Grey, Byrd Gang, and Dyce Payso. His last project was March’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Back In My Prime</a>, released in collaboration with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hitmaka</a>.
