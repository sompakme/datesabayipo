The then-18-weeks-pregnant 24-year-old and her husband, Fabian Guerrero-Moreno, were driving on a highway in San Marcos, Texas, when a drunk motorist in the oncoming lane collided with their Toyota Corolla. Guerrero-Moreno, who was sitting in the passenger seat, died at the scene. Two days later, after nearly 24 hours of induced labor, Kristian delivered a stillborn baby boy. Watch her tell her story in the clip above.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>Shana Lee Elliott, a 21-year-old Texas State University student, faces two charges of intoxication manslaughter and intoxication assault with a vehicle. When police spoke to Elliott, she admitted that prior to the accident she consumed beer and liquor while tubing on the Guadalupe River, </span><a href=#>KXAN</a><span> reported in August. She remains in jail on $385,000 bond, per the </span><i><a href=#>Houston Chronicle.</a></i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It’s been nearly two months since the tragedy and Kristian says&nbsp;she misses her best friend every single day. “Something will happen and I want to come home and tell Fabian about it, then I realize he’s gone,” the cosmetology student tells <i>Us Weekly.</i> “I’m living a nightmare.”</p><p>She continued: “Every night I have to go to bed and he’s not there next to me, and I just lay awake because he used to provide that feeling of security and safety. And now he’s gone.”</p><p>A joint funeral for Guerrero-Moreno and their baby was held August 12. Kristian named the child Fabian James, after his dad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“He looked just like his father,” says Kristian, who was able to hold the newborn in her arms. “I thought when I delivered my baby that my husband was going to be there loving on me and supporting me like he always did. That chance was taken away from us.”</p><p>But Kristian knows Guerrero-Moreno is watching over her. “I literally walked to the ambulance. The only injury I have to deal with for the rest of my life is a scar above my right eye. And I really feel like that’s for a reason.”</p><p>On September 8, Kristian shared two photos on Facebook: one of their totaled car, and another of herself in the hospital cradling Fabian James. “Everybody has been seeing photos of our wedding and it’s just a beautiful couple,” Kristian tells <i>Us.</i> “I wanted people to see the hurt, the pain and all the damage that a drunk driver caused.”&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href=#>madd.org</a>, every day in America, 27 people die as a result of drunk driving crashes.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamp51ixKm7jKWmrKxdncK0rsCnm2aZnpl6trrBqKmnZZKWr7p506hknaqlo7husNGirZ6qXai9pq3KrGSoraRixHWAkG9nbGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-caine-biography-age-family-wife-children-real-name-name-change-net-worth-movies-and-t.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Caine Biography, Age, Family, Wife, Children, Real Name/Name Change, Net Worth, Movies and T</span></a>
