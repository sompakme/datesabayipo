So, having a different sized pack that’ll have a different price point, that'll take some pressure off the consumer while they're shopping.</p><p>"So, those are some of the things that we’re doing, but, in general, the cereal category is a place that a lot of folks might come to, because the price of a bowl of cereal with milk and with fruit is less than a dollar. So you can imagine why a consumer under pressure might find that to be a good place to go."</p><p>As Pilnick indicated, Kellogg's "cereal for dinner" marketing strategy appeared in advertisements, such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one shared to YouTube</a> back in August 2022:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To Quintilla's credit, immediately after Pilnick recommended "cereal for dinner," the CNBC host responded:</p><p>I'm all for innovation and marketing, but the idea of having cereal for dinner ... is there the potential for that to... land the wrong way?</p><p>Pilnick demurred, asserting in response:</p><p>"We don't think so. In fact, it's landing really well right now, Carl."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kanye-bankruptcy-vultures.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>It's Rough Right Now</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kanye Is Building Back His Billion-Dollar Fortune With ‘Vultures’ Release After Almost Going Bankrupt</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The rapper says he narrowly avoided bankruptcy after his Super Bowl ad garnered millions in sales for Yeezy.</span><h2 id=kellogg-39-s-39-cereal-for-dinner-39-backlash>Kellogg's 'Cereal For Dinner' Backlash</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/gary-pilnick-kellogg-ceo-cereal-for-dinner.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pilnick seemed confident Kellogg's "cereal for dinner" marketing was "landing really well" – but comments under the video told a different story.</p><p>Two of the top YouTube comments characterized some immediate consumer sentiment, reading:</p><p>"I'm sorry but who and what ceo would even have the confidence to say something like this? I'm 30 something and cereal for dinner isn't nutrition. Low income does this for something vs nothing."</p><p>"Could you imagine his maid serving up cereal prepared by his chef on his fine china to his wife and children for dinner😂"</p><p>Variations of "let them eat cake" were rife in the comments, and another user responded to Pilnick's references to smaller cereal boxes:</p><p>"People: we don't have dinner, we starving</p><p>"CEO: then just eat cereals</p><p>"People: but they expensive</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"CEO: We hear you! we're making the packs smaller, so it costs less &lt;3"</p><p>On the above-linked Reddit post, comments were similar, but not everyone was laughing:</p><p>"Cereal is like $7-8 a box now for the big boxes that hold less than the normal size did years ago. Cheaper to make your own meal out of other things.</p><p>"I rarely buy cereal anymore. Let them eat cake has become let them eat cereal? Well I hope he remembers what happened to the one who said the cake line."</p><p>It's not entirely clear where Pilnick's "cereal for dinner" line was "going over well," because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discourse on Twitter (X)</a> was roundly critical.</p><p>Users <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">described the remarks as indicative</a> of "greedflation," and cited Kellogg's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">profitability in recent quarters</a>:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kellogg's CEO Gary Pilnick's "cereal for dinner" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">comments came at a time</a> when Americans more routinely struggle to afford groceries, spending more than eleven percent of their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disposable income on food</a> in 2022, per the USDA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpJ2cobyos9Jmmp6nXZyus8WMqaClppmYuLR5wp6pnpmcYrOwvoydoKemlad8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julie-blanchard-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Julie Blanchard Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
