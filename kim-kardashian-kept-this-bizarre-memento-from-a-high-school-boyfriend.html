However, all of these relationships have resulted in a break-up of some sort, with some being amicable enough (Pete Davidson) and others being bad (<a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>).</p><p>One aspect of these break-ups that makes Kim stand out from everyone else going through a breakup is that she likes to keep a little memento of the relationship, even if it ended terribly. While many might still have photos of their ex on their phone or social media, Kim prefers to have a more physical reminder of the person.</p><h2 id=who-has-kim-kardashian-dated>Who Has Kim Kardashian Dated?</h2><p>Having carved a name for herself in the public eye and having pretty much every aspect of her and her family's lives documented for TV shows, there isn't much that isn't known about the Kardashians. One part of their lives that is often talked about is their relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar47823387-1.jpg><p>Just like anyone else, the family has had their fair share of heartbreak, with much of this being reported on by the press. However, it can sometimes be challenging to keep up with who exactly Kim has dated and what happened to each relationship when it broke down.</p><p>Kim has been married three times. The <a href=#>first marriage was to Damon Thomas</a>, which happened when she wasn't as well known. There was then her <a href=#>marriage to Kris Humphries</a>, with a special episode of the wedding being filmed for Keeping Up With The Kardashians and it also being famous for having only lasted 72 days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The final marriage was to her most recent husband, Kanye West. With Kanye, Kim had four children and after seemingly having had quite the love story, the <a href=#>pair ended up officially getting divorced</a> in 2022.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kourtney-kardashian-slams-sister-kim-for-creating-an-anti-kourtney-group-chat-with-her-friends.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Kourtney Kardashian Slams Sister Kim For Creating An “Anti-Kourtney” Group Chat With Her Friends ">Kourtney Kardashian Slams Sister Kim For Creating An “Anti-Kourtney” Group Chat With Her Friends</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kim defended herself after revealing she has a group chat with Kourtney's friends where they gossip about her.</p><p>Aside from her marriages, she has also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had a few other relationships</a>.

This was all discussed during an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, where it was revealed that both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim and Kourtney like to keep an ex box</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kim-and-khloe-kardashian.jpg><p>The Kardashians are known for keeping their exes quite close to them, with <a href=#>Khloé still remaining quite close to Tristan Thompson</a> for a while after they broke up until the most recent cheating allegations came to light and <a href=#>Kim was even said to have been trying to maintain a friendship with Kanye</a> after their divorce.</p><p>This all happened when <a href=#>Khloé was getting divorced</a> from Lamar Odom, with <a href=#><strong>Khloé</strong></a> saying that she wanted to shred every photo she had of him. However, <a href=#><strong>Kourtney</strong></a> and Kim suggested that she needed to keep the pictures as something to look back on the relationship, then going on to reveal that they each have an ex box.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-kim-kardashian-keep-in-her-ex-box>What Does Kim Kardashian Keep In Her Ex Box?</h2><p>With the revelation that she and her sister keep an ex box, this might lead to many fans wondering what exactly Kim keeps in hers.

However, one thing that was most noticeable was that, despite her array of famous boyfriends, the one that seemed to take over her box the most was her <a href=#>high school boyfriend, TJ Jackson</a>.</p><p>This included photos of them together at a school event, items from when they visited the Neverland Ranch that belonged to his uncle Michael Jackson, and even an empty box of chicken nuggets that she had during their first-ever date.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kim-kardashian-white-outfit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Fans Demand Kim Kardashian Be Canceled As She Supports Balenciaga A Year After Its Child Abuse Scandal">Fans Demand Kim Kardashian Be Canceled As She Supports Balenciaga A Year After Its Child Abuse Scandal</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kim Kardashian previously slammed Balenciaga, but she's proven to still be open to working with the controversial brand.</p><p>Both Kim and Kourtney clearly want to look back on these times, regardless of whether they were happy or not, but Khloé seemed less than impressed with the idea.
