Though in truth, he looks rather different these days. Let's take a look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=working-on-39-friends-39-was-a-stressful-experience-for-eddie-cahill-as-tag>Working On 'Friends' Was A Stressful Experience For Eddie Cahill As Tag</h2><p>In his early 20s, Eddie Cahill was a nervous soldier during his 'Friends' audition. The actor barely had any money in his pocket, in truth, he just had enough to audition for the show. <a href=#>He ended up getting the role but wasn't easy</a>, as he revealed alongside Media Village.</p><p>"The final audition was on a Tuesday and down to myself and Tom Welling (Clark Kent on Smallville),” he recalled. “They bought us to set and whoever got the role was going to go to right to rehearsals. I remember walking into a room with Marta Kaufman, David Crane, Kevin Bright, and Jennifer Aniston and they could see I was terrified.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Here's Why Friends' Creators Named This Guest Star The Show's Worst</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The audition was a huge success and it changed Cahilll's career for good. Soon enough, he was meeting the likes of Brad Pitt behind the scenes on the show. In addition, he revealed that Jen Aniston was always great to him.</p><p>“She really let me have a voice on the set,” he recalled. “There was one moment I remember in particular; we were trying to work on a joke in rehearsal and I kind of leaned in with an idea and she said, ‘Hey, Eddie has an idea and it's a pretty good one. Let's try it.’ She allowed me to have a voice, which was very cool.”</p><p>The seven episodes changed his career and later, he would move on to other projects, keeping busy along the way.</p><h2 id=eddie-cahill-is-still-active-in-the-business-recently-joining-39-fantasy-island-39>Eddie Cahill Is Still Active In The Business Recently Joining 'Fantasy Island'</h2><p>At the age of 43, Eddie Cahill is still very much in the business. He had kept consistent, especially with TV roles on shows like NCIS: New Orleans, LA's Finest, Hawaii Five-O, and a slew of other popular programs. His most recent cameo was on 'Fantasy Island', playing the role of 'Mr. Right' on the 'Holiday Special' episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>This Iconic 'Friends' Guest Star Absolutely Hated The Cast, Here's Why\</a></span></p><p>Despite such an impressive resume, he's still mostly recognized for his seven-episode appearance on 'Friends'. Cahill admitted alongside The Latch, <a href=#>he'll still get noticed on the norm for the role as Tag.</a></p><p>"Hands down this is the one that people recognize me from. It’s really kind of remarkable."</p><p>"I had this experience maybe a year or two ago as it was coming back. I have an elementary school-aged child and I was walking through the school — and the other stuff I’ve done is mostly watched by older people or an older demographic and I started to notice these sixth-grade girls staring. I was like, hang on a second. Something must be going on.

He's seen rocking the gray beard during his time on 'LA's Finest'. Certainly, quite the change in appearance, long gone are the days of the long hair and baby face, and in are the days of a mature, and gray beard look.</p><p>Kudos to Cahill for staying active throughout the years since his ark on the show. For the actor, a lot of it is just basic luck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I got lucky in some ways. I think some of it can be attributed to the drive I had, and the willingness to say yes to myself and having some support. It really does just seem like Providence, you know what I mean? It seems like I really had so little to do with it, you know, and I know that’s not true, but it’s true."</p><p>"But there is an element of that, that I’m like allowing because I think when I was younger, I fought for the idea that I was going to do this and I knew I needed to do it because it felt super."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>This Comedy Legend Got Rejected By 'Friends' Twice</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyapaKrpKS7brHDnaCeZZOWtaq4y2apmpuYmrluwMCgZKOnnprAbrPRmrBmrZ6nsqS7xqegs5mSobJuw8eeqZ5lkaeybsDHnrBmpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ava-eliot-jackman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Ava Eliot Jackman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
