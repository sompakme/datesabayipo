Now that fans have watched the family for so many years, they wonder about Jill Duggar's net worth and how many kids does Jill Duggar have. Since <a href=#>Jill didn't earn much on reality TV</a>, it's no wonder that Jill and her husband Derick Dillard decided to be totally honest about their experiences with her family. She has shared a lot, including <a href=#>criticism of her parents' decision to put their kids on TV</a>.</p><p>In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>how Derick Dillard and Jill Duggar's difficult relationship with Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar changed their net worth</strong>.

The couple wrote the book about realizing they needed to break free from the Duggars and live their own lives. While several family members have written memoirs over the years, including a <a href=#>Duggar book from 2008</a>, Counting the Cost tells an emotional story from Jill and Derick's unique and heartbreaking perspective.</p><p>According to The Ashley's Reality Roundup, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Derick Dillard talked about the book on The Ramsey Show</a> in the fall of 2023. Jill and Derick were <strong>given</strong><strong>$50,000 on September 12th, 2023</strong>, which is when Counting the Cost was published.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/jill-duggar-dillard-derick-dillard.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The publication noted that Derick also shed light on his family's financial situation. He said that while their 2022 income was $65,000, he and Jill <strong>thought that their 2023 income would be $150,000</strong>. They also thought that their 2024 income would be $85,000. Derick also mentioned that they paid their mortgage and had $50,000 in the bank in case anything went wrong.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/how-many-of-the-duggars-have-moved-far-away-from-home-and-why-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Many Of The Duggars Have Moved Far Away From Home (And Why)?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Did any of the Duggar family's kids take the first opportunity to move away from their home in Arkansas?

Even though the two were reality stars for a long time, that doesn't mean that they took home tons of money. In fact, it was the opposite.

According to People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Derick commented on a Facebook post about Jim Bob</a> running for the Arkansas State Senate. He wrote that his opinion of his father-in-law had become more negative over time. He wrote, "Unfortunately, it's only become clearer to us over time just how deep this man's manipulation and deceit will go for his own gain, at the expense of others."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In September 2023, Jill Duggar said in an interview with CNN that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she would like to talk to her parents again</a>.

That isn't the case. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jill Duggar and Derick Dillard have two children</a>: Israel, who was born in 2015, and Samuel, who was born in 2017, according to Us Weekly.</p><p>However, Jill said that her father <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Bob Duggar expects to have many grandchildren</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Daily Mail reported that Jill and Derick were interviewed on the podcast Ask Dr. Julie Hanks, Derick said, "There's also a sense of hierarchy that you're less [valued] if you have less kids." He said that Michelle and Jim Bob used to say "whoever has the most kids gets the house." He noted that although it was meant to be a funny comment, he and Jill think that Jim Bob was serious.</p><p>Jill Duggar said on the podcast that <strong>her father's expectations made her feel bad</strong>. She explained, "Am I being punished for my lack of desire of having 20 kids? All those mind games that you play." It sounds like this is just one reason why Jill Duggar and Derick Dillard continue to struggle with the Duggar family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibnqqZmLhusMilo5qqlGK3qrjLZpuun5eWv7R5xKyrq5menLKusc2tZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harley-dean-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Harley Dean Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
