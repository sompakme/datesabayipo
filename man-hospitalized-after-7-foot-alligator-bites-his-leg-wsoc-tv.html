They recommend planning ahead of time to reduce chances of encountering them. They also suggest avoiding or being overly cautious around bodies of water and vegetation because female alligators may have a nest as it is alligator mating season. Officials say that it is not clear if this female alligator had a nest or not.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The name of the man has not been released.</p><p>Latest headlines:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKyimrultc2gZqaZnmK1sL%2FPoquapJmvsqV5wJ%2BrnqpdbHqnu86tZJqknJ60osDOq2SboaSawG60yKxkpZ2XZJaToKKGeG1qdnuRdZChko6GanN%2BhJmmpn58aA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./king-kong-bundy-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>King Kong Bundy Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
