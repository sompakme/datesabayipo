The first city on the list was Paris. Just like the rest of her tour, these last few shows also had their fair share of unscripted moments.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-made-a-special-point-to-acknowledge-the-87th-show><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Taylor Swift Made A Special Point To Acknowledge the 87th Show</span></h2><h3 id=location-eras-tour-paris>Location: Eras Tour, Paris</h3><p>On the fourth night of the Paris leg, Kelce was in attendance, <a href=#>along with Bradley Cooper and Gigi Hadid</a>. During the show, Swift said, "Can you believe it's our 87th show?" during her acoustic set.

According to USA Today, temperatures in Rio reached nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit on Friday, November 17th, during Taylor Swift’s concert. The award-winning singer was in the stadium performing to close to 60,000 people when she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">noticed some struggling to stay hydrated</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift was performing on the piano when fans began screaming they needed water. The songstress stopped her performance and urged her staff to pass out water to those in the crowd. She said, “There are people that need water right here, maybe 30, 35, 40 feet back. So whoever is in charge of giving them that, just make sure that happens. Can I get a signal that you know where they are?” Swift continued, “We don’t need to chant; it's totally fine. We just need to get water to them.”</p><p>Fans praised Swift for acting so quickly to assist dehydrated fans. But despite her efforts, Brazilian newspapers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported that close to 1000 people fainted</a>, while others vomited from experiencing severe dehydration.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-interrupts-her-concert-to-celebrate-39-midnights-39-6-grammy-nominations><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Taylor Swift Interrupts Her Concert To Celebrate 'Midnights' 6 Grammy Nominations</span></h2><h3 id=location-eras-tour-argentina>Location: Eras Tour, Argentina</h3><p>Taylor Swift’s 2022 album, Midnights, received six Grammy Nominations while she was in Argentina for her Eras Tour. While performing the Evermore set on her piano, Taylor went off-script and began talking about her nominations. “I started off my morning by getting the extraordinary news that because of you and because of the way you’ve supported my album Midnights, it just got nominated for six Grammys.”</p><p>Swift followed her short speech with an adorable victory dance while seated at the piano. According to Billboard, the album was the first to occupy all top 10 spots on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-surprises-fans-by-bringing-out-taylor-lautner-during-eras-tour><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Taylor Swift Surprises Fans By Bringing Out Taylor Lautner During Eras Tour</span></h2><h3 id=location-eras-tour-kansas-city>Location: Eras Tour, Kansas City</h3><p>One of the most memorable moments from the first leg of the Ears Tour happened when Taylor Swift brought her ex-boyfriend, Taylor Lautner, out on stage. The Twilight actor and Swift have been great friends since their relationship came to an end, and like many of her exes, she wrote a song about him.</p><p>Taylor Lautner, who inspired the song “Back To December,” gave Swifties a night they will never forget, starting with his impressive entrance at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. Lautner joined Swift, Joey King, and Presley Cash as they debuted the music video for “I Can See You.” Swift praised Lautner and said he was a tremendous source of positivity in her life while she made the Speak Now album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-stops-singing-to-thank-fans-for-cristo-redentor-honoring-her-visit-to-brazil><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Taylor Swift Stops Singing To Thank Fans For Cristo Redentor, Honoring Her Visit To Brazil</span></h2><h3 id=location-eras-tour-brazil>Location: Eras Tour, Brazil</h3><p>Fans were excited when Taylor Swift announced her Eras Tour would be in Brazil. Brazilian Swifties donated food and water for the upcoming Catholic Church’s World Day of the Poor to show Taylor their love. In return for their charitable acts, Swifties partnered with the Redeemer Archdiocesan Sanctuary to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">illuminate the world-famous Christ statue to wear Taylor’s iconic shirt</a> from her “You Belong With Me” music video.

The singer-songwriter completely forgot the lyrics to her music while performing. She said, “Oh my God, the words.

One of her Christian Louboutin heels broke mid-performance, and, to fix it, Swift went utterly off-script. The singer ripped the bottom half of the heel off and threw it to a lucky fan in the crowd.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor didn't let the broken heel stop her from performing</a> for her fans and continued the show by standing on one heel.

However, on the third night of her show in Tokyo, things took a scary turn as Swift almost fell off the roof after taking her harness off. But in true Swift fashion, she shook it off, addressed the audience, and went on.</p><p>"I almost fell off the Folklore cabin, but I didn’t and that’s the lesson. My life flashed before my eyes, yeah, no, I’m good. It’s all good. Everything’s fine,” Swift explained to the crowd. "Everything’s great!

While Kelce got another shoutout while in Australia, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift changed the lyrics to another song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"</a> with the help of her backup dancer, Kam.</p><p>Instead of singing, "Like, ever" per her original song, Kam included Aussie slang, such as, "Yeah, nah", "Bugger off", "Rack off, mate", and "Tell him he's dreamin'" all of which were met with excitement from fans.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-added-a-new-era-to-the-eras-tour><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Taylor Swift Added A New Era To The Eras Tour</span></h2><h3 id=location-eras-tour-paris>Location: Eras Tour, Paris</h3><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift kicked off the European leg of her tour in Paris. While some Swifties were wondering if Swift would be adding some songs from The Tortoured Poets Department, no one expected her to add a TTPD Era to the mix. What shocked fans even more is how long the era had been worked on before its debut in Paris.</p><p>"We started planning this surprise for you about eight or nine months ago and then when we got two months off of the Eras Tour," Swift explained. "We really didn’t take any time off at all. We just went directly back into rehearsals. So I’d like to give it up for my crew, my dancers, and my band."</p><p>Seven songs from TTPD are now part of the Eras Tour, while Evermore and Folklore have been combined as one era.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-has-changed-up-her-outfits-for-the-european-tour><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Taylor Swift Has Changed Up Her Outfits For The European Tour</span></h2><h3 id=location-eras-tour-paris>Location: Eras Tour, Paris</h3><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to adding The Tortured Poets Department Era to the set list, Swift changed many of the outfits fans were used to seeing from the previous legs of the tour. The changes include:</p><h3 id=lover-era>Lover Era</h3><p>To open the show, Swift wore a new sparkling bodysuit and boots in the colors of maroon, red, and orange. After her opening songs, Swift transitions into "The Man" by wearing a blazer in the same colors as the new bodysuit.</p><h3 id=fearless-era>Fearless Era</h3><p>Instead of the gold sparkling outfit fans were accustomed to, Swift wore a black and silver sparkling bodysuit adorned with fringe.</p><h3 id=1989-era>1989 Era</h3><p>Depending on which night fans went to in Paris, there were different looks that Swift wore during this era.</p><p>Instead of the maroon top and skirt Swift had previously worn, that was replaced by a bustier and skirt. Just what color bustier and skirt fans saw depended on the night they were in attendance. So far, Swift has worn a pink bustier and turquoise skirt, a green bustier and pink skirt, and a yellow bustier and red skirt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=midnights-era>Midnights Era</h3><p>Swift still kept the dark blue theme to her ensemble, but it was slightly reconfigured from the original, adding in some black detailing and adding a halter top into the mix as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1llaeutHnTqKyrZZ%2Bbs26%2FwqugqaxdorKuu9GamaWdXaK8rrHNrapmq6WnvbO10p6qaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stargate-movies-in-order-how-to-watch-stargate-films.html><span>←</span><span>Stargate Movies in Order How to Watch Stargate Films</span></a>
