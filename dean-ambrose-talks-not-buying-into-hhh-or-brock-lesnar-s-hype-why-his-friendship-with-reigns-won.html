One, there are few people in the world who can come that close to the WWE Championship, and that feeling is intoxicating. The second thing he learned is that he lost fair and square, but he doesn’t feel like Triple H kicked his a**. Ambrose said, however, that people gloss over the fact that he is one of the best in this business. He added no one can brawl and fight and do everything in WWE like he can do. Ambrose praised Triple H for being one of the best, but on his best day, which is at WrestleMania, he thinks Triple H cannot beat him.</p><p>On his Triple Threat WWE World Title match at WWE Fastlane, Ambrose says it doesn’t matter that his best friend Roman Reigns is in the match. He said he’s fought Reigns before, and he never had any excuse not to fight Reigns. On Lesnar, Ambrose said he likes Lesnar personally, but he’s starting to get pissed off about the thought of Lesnar. Ambrose asks if he’s supposed to be scared of the marketing of Brock Lesnar as “The Beast”, and he says he’s not scared. Ambrose said he could get dumped on his head 60 times by Lesnar, and Ambrose will either get back up or he won’t. But Ambrose said that Lesnar will get tired in the match, and that’s when he’ll get taken out by Ambrose.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgpVwb2xrXZmyorqMmqSbqp%2Bosm7AwKWirGWepMFurtSyoKefXZ67tbuMoZ%2BhZZ%2BneqO%2BzpyiZqSVqLuivtJmn7KolWLEqcWMoaCsZZantqa6w6yfoqhdrLa1tIyrnKKfnqh6uLvNrWSanpaasLV5xZqqraSRo7Jurc2dZKanopo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-yesenia-vega-kitt-new-york-pastry-chef-slammed-for-anti-semitic-remarks.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Yesenia Vega-Kitt?
