One of the most exciting parts of living through the ’90s (showing my age here) was all the fun jelly-inspired fashion options there were. In fact, I think about it a lot.

In fact, I think about it a lot. It’s kind of my Roman empire, as I mentioned in the title here – I remember my favorite pair of jelly shoes and jelly bracelets growing up, and all the blisters I’d get from wearing them. Didn’t matter because it was ~fashion~, so it was all about how the jellies matched my favorite dress and not how they made my feet hurt.</p><p>I also had a jelly purse I had found at a thrift store, which was more from the ’80s, but it was endlessly fascinating to me because it was something I had never considered that could actually be crafted from the material. So imagine my surprise when I stumbled upon a jelly tote bag in 2024. It felt like going on some sort of archaeological dig and finding a great discovery.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">No Boundaries Lattice Jelly Tote Bag</a> is just $18 right now at Walmart, and you’re definitely going to wand to get your own. It’s exactly what it looks like: a tote, but made out of hardy jelly materials. It comes in Black, White, Aqua Summer (light blue) and Bright Flamingo (pink), and has a long strap that you can carry it with so you can bring all your stuff to the pool with you without worrying about it getting drenched, like you would with a regular tote bag. It’s all plastic!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">No Boundaries Lattice Jelly Tote Bag</a>&nbsp;for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$18 </a>at Walmart!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Of course, for many of us it’s far too cold right now to use as a beach tote. You don’t have to do so, because it can work as a regular tote too! You’ll just look extra cool strutting your stuff with this fun tote that looks totally unlike what everyone else has right now.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">No Boundaries Lattice Jelly Tote Bag</a>&nbsp;for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$18 </a>at Walmart!</strong></p><p>It only has to be winter outside – you can have tons of fun planning outfits and wearing interesting things when you get pieces like this one. And for just $18, it’s well worth it to buy one or two if you think about going back to the days of jellies like I do. I can’t get enough of ’em. So take this piece of pop culture history and run with it, why not?</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">No Boundaries Lattice Jelly Tote Bag</a>&nbsp;for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$18 </a>at Walmart!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOprBmqp%2Birq95xKanoqqVYra0edOhoKxlm57BtK%2FHsmRyaKNit6a4y7Jkraekmnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mama-june-net-worth-how-much-is-june-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Mama June Net Worth How Much is June Worth?</span></a>
