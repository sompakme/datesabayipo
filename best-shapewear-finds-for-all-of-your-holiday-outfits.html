Available for sizes XXS-5XL — starting at $36!</p><p><strong>2. The Icon! </strong>Spanx is practically synonymous with shapewear.

Going Strapless! </strong>Show off your shoulders with the help of this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Body Beautiful Shapewear strapless bodysuit</a>. It comes in three colors — $28!</p><p><strong>4. Open Up!</strong> Hate when bodysuits squash down your bust and create a flat uniboob effect? Check out this open-bust&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shapermint bodysuit</a> — $28!</p><p><strong>5. Sleeves, Please!&nbsp;</strong>This&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Eleady long-sleeve bodysuit</a> is great for under your clothing, but you could totally wear it as your top too. Try it with a metallic midi skirt — $29!</p><h4>Shorts</h4><p><strong>6.

We also love that they come in five colors — $26!</p><p><strong>8. Booty Rockin’ Everywhere!&nbsp;</strong>Tummy control is great, but if you’re looking for a little extra lift and sculpt for your booty, you’ll love the “3D peach” design on these&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Simpline shorts</a> — $28!</p><p><strong>9.

Silky Satin!&nbsp;</strong>The “liquid stretch” satin fabric of these&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Spanx shaping briefs</a> is totally dreamy. It’s breathable too — $34!</p><p><strong>14. High, High Waist!&nbsp;</strong>Some shapewear is focused solely on the lower belly, but these ultra-high-waisted&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shapermint panties</a> rise up near the bust for a super smooth look — $24!</p><p><strong>15. Four-Way Stretch!&nbsp;</strong>You get not one but two amazingly stretchy&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bali fajas</a> with your purchase of this highly-rated shaping underwear — on sale for $19!</p><p><strong>16.

Squared Away!&nbsp;</strong>Square necklines are trendy, which is why we love this shaping&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">VVX tank</a> as both an undergarment and a visible top — $20!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Looking for something else?
