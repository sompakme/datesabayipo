Lil Twist <a href=#>has driven</a> his white Ferrari, and now Odd Future’s Tyler, the Creator has been behind the wheel of the luxury performance vehicle. Unfortunately for Bieber, Tyler drove the car too fast, pissed off some neighbors, who got the police involved and are now investigating the Biebs for reckless driving. It all started on May 27 when former NFL player Keyshawn Johnson saw Bieber’s Ferrari speed by in their gated Calabasas neighborhood. Johnson followed the Ferrari, in his Prius nonethless, to Bieber’s home. Three other witnesses said they saw Bieber behind the wheel, but Bieber’s security team alleges it was Tyler behind the wheel and they have video to prove it. On Saturday, Tyler took to Twitter to take the blame.</p><p>That Was Me Behind The Wheel Of Justins Vehicle. Don’t Blame Him.

This isn’t the first time Bieber has pissed off his neighbors, most who are freaked one of their kids is going to get run over by that white Ferrari. In March, Bieber allegedly <a href=#>spit in a neighbor’s face</a> after he complained about his fast driving. Moral of the story: slow down.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6nGrbHRZpqrnZGpvLN5wJ2koqyjYr%2Bmr8qlnKyrnK56pb7Ir6Cnn12fwrTAyKdkm6GVl7Kzv4yfnKuqkae2bn2Ucmhya18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tony-hayward-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Hayward Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
