Obviously, the first was about a new album.</p><p>While Niall may not have given much thought to washing and moisturizing his face when he was in 1D, he has since come to his senses. "As I head into my thirties, I'm trying to keep the baby face for as long as possible. When I was younger, I didn't really care about it. I was really a boy about it. Then I decided I was going to look after this thing."</p><p>We love to see a king that cares about his skin! But he’s also a mega-celebrity, so before getting started on his 22-step skincare routine, let’s first figure out if we can even afford some of these products.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=niall-horan-uses-the-sarah-chapman-skinesis-ultimate-cleanse><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Niall Horan Uses The Sarah Chapman Skinesis Ultimate Cleanse</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1-12.png><p>After he has his hair styled to perfection, Niall Horan soaks his face with cold water and uses Sarah Chapman's Ultimate Cleanse as a cleanser.</p><p>This product is an omega-rich cleanser that removes all traces of makeup from the face and eyes, deep cleans, conditions, and brightens with the help of collagen-stimulating peptides and powerful skin-defense antioxidants.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Harry Styles Wants You To Have Watermelons, They Actually Work Wonders For Your Skin</a></span></p><p>This complexion-enhancing cleanser is packaged in an airless pump to preserve the integrity of its vitamin and antioxidant-rich formula, which are sensitive to light and air.</p><p>What’s the damage? The Sarah Chapman Skinesis Ultimate Cleanse comes in 30mL and 100mL, priced at $24 and $67, respectively.

Enter: the Make Beauty Micro Crystalline Exfoliating Face Mask.</p><p>This facial polishing treatment successfully removes dulling dead skin cells while being soothing to the skin. The exfoliating mask aids in refinement and resurfacing thanks to its formulation of very fine, microcrystalline cellulose, glycolic acid, lactic acid, and fermented bio-sourced bisabolol.</p><p>The product's main components, lactic acid and glycolic acid, work together to gently exfoliate and smoothen skin, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and resurface the appearance of uneven texture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This product is priced at $36 for a 50mL tub, which is pretty reasonable.

He says the treatment helps his voice and opens up his pores.</p><p>Following a good steam, he gives the BRO MASK Under Eye Gel Pads a try on his under eyes. When compared to competing eye care solutions, the thick gel-like substance of these pads greatly improves their ability to adhere to the skin.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Timothée Chalamet's Skincare Regimen Is Surprisingly Simple</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bakuchiol, a plant-based retinol alternative that lays gently on the face and firms, tightens, and brightens weary eyes, is the secret ingredient that makes this product stand out.</p><p>The tub comes with six pairs of under-eye gel pads, and it’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">priced at $30 on its website</a>, which is pricey for only six applications.

Yes, it does all of these things!</p><p>Feeling like you're at a spa without leaving the house is possible with the help of ice rollers; simply place the rollers in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes, apply your favorite cream, and pull them back out to experience one of the <a href=#>best home remedies for your skin</a>.</p><p>Ice rollers are available everywhere and can range from $7 onwards (for a quality choice, of course). High-rated yet effective ice rollers price at $25 to $30 on Amazon, but if you want to take it up a notch, go bigger!</p><h2 id=niall-horan-hydrates-with-the-sarah-chapman-skinesis-intense-hydrating-booster><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Niall Horan Hydrates With The Sarah Chapman Skinesis Intense Hydrating Booster</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5-7.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After giving his eyes a thorough "love prep," Niall uses another Sarah Chapman product to hydrate and restore equilibrium to his skin.</p><p>A blend of hydrators and immune-defense skin protectors, the Sarah Chapman Skinesis Intense Hydrating Booster soothes dry skin like it’s nobody’s business, being one of the <a href=#>best hydrating agents that keep your skin from drying out</a>.</p><p>The product contains Bioecolia, which helps guard against airborne microorganisms and irritants, increasing your hydration levels. As a result, the skin's natural barrier is improved, and the skin itself feels relaxed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Skincare Products Do Celebrities Like Jennifer Garner And Nicole Kidman Use To Stay Looking So Youthful?</a></span></p><p>In this day and age of ongoing pandemic, a product that guards against harsh environmental variables could accomplish far more than you realize. And the price expresses that for sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming only in a 30mL tub, the product costs $86. Yikes! It’s got some great reviews, but we totally understand if you skip out on this one. Maybe we revert to <a href=#>Elizabeth Olsen’s affordable skincare recommendations at this point</a>.</p><h2 id=does-niall-horan-use-the-bright-start-retinol-alternative-eye-cream><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Does Niall Horan Use The Bright Start Retinol Alternative Eye Cream?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/niall-horan-on-the-voice.jpg><p>Niall admitted that dark eyes run in his family, so he'll have to take another run with his eyes to maintain them plump and fresh.</p><p>Clinical studies have shown that using the Bright Start Retinol Alternative Eye Cream before applying concealer can significantly improve the appearance of dark circles, fine lines, and puffiness around the eyes.</p><p>The device features a cooling ceramic tip that can also be used as a massage tool, and it is shaped like a pearl that reflects light.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And did we say that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">product was also clinically proven</a>? This is crucial since the retinol alternative made from sustainably harvested ingredients visibly brightens, firms, and softens the face without the disadvantages of regular retinol, which can be too harsh for delicate skin.</p><p>For legit results with improving dark under eyes and fine lines, you’d only have to dish out $46, which is perfectly reasonable! It does only come in a 15ml tube, but a little goes a long way.</p><p>Once Niall has pampered his eyes for the last time, he applies his SPF lip balm, a little bit of hairspray, and a spritz of his favorite perfume, and voila! He’s ready to rock your world at his next concert.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyaqZ5lnp6urbiMoaarmZ6oerS3yKeamqqVYr2zu8Oumq2rXam1osCMoZxmraOawG61zWafoqtdmL%2BixthmaWtlo6mysXnRqKytoZ6afA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./8-wrestlers-who-love-brock-lesnar-and-7-that-ripped-him.html><span>←</span><span>8 Wrestlers Who Love Brock Lesnar And 7 That Ripped Him</span></a>
