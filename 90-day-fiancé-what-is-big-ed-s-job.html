<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>90 Day Fianc: What Is Big Eds Job?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It goes without saying that Big Ed from&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">90 Day Fiancé</a></strong>&nbsp;is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial to say the least</a>. The American man seemed adorable at first, when he headed to the Philippines to go get his crush Rosemarie “Rose” Vega. However, sweet quickly turned sour as far as the reality TV star’s attitude towards his partner got critical. The media personality made it pretty clear that he thought <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rose’s living conditions</a> were not up to his standards when he visited her home. Awkward. Then, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Ed did something to Rose</a> that nobody should do to anybody, let alone their partner: he created a fake Instagram to troll his fiancé. Yikes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, fans are wondering what Big Ed does for a living. Did he have a job before going on the television show? And if so, how has his time on 90 Day Fiancé&nbsp;effected his career? Read on for the inside scoop:</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘90 Day Fiancé’: Biniyam Shibre & Fredrick Weinberg Fight Over Baby’s Religion</a></span></p><h2 id=a-scandalous-picture-this>A Scandalous ‘Picture This’</h2><p>Big Ed actually had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a career as a photographer</a> prior to shooting&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé.&nbsp;According to a report by&nbsp;Screen Rant,&nbsp;the reality TV star actually had a prestigious arts education before going into the area. He is an alum of the famed postgraduate institution The New School in New York City. The photographer even has his own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook page titled EA Brown</a>, where he displays some of his best shots, although his favorite subject is way more scandalous than some fans may have thought.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/930EE51F-C132-42FB-A50B-367FEEAF5E64-e1605896593521.jpeg><p>The EA Brown Facebook page is full of photos of scantily clad women. Yes, you read that right. Big Ed’s favorite photography subjects are girls dressed in nothing but their underwear. We are not sure that Rose would have approved! Nonetheless, Ed’s photography website advertises what he calls a “boudoir photoshoot” for women, which he prices at a whooping $180 dollars. Very pricey!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘90 Day Fiancé’: Brittany Faces Yazan’s Marriage Ultimatum As Her Instagram Modeling Career Takes Off</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shifting-towards-new-goals>Shifting Towards New Goals</h2><p>While Big Ed used to earn a living through sensual photographs, he now runs an Instagram account with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">intentionally unattractive shots</a>. Primarily of himself. The former photographer makes a point of sharing super grainy photos, where he appears at odd angles meant to exaggerate certain facial features. He has even been known to post pictures of himself in semi-compromising positions: rolling around in bed, stuffing his face with a greasy drumstick, wearing a fuzzy white plushy on his head.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3B679015-D112-4D33-B984-D5BD9FF3C294-e1605896651134.jpeg><p>But can the reality star monetize his totally cringe-worthy Insta photos? Big Ed currently boasts over 400k followers, which means that his potential for endorsement money is oh-so real. On top of that, there are rumors floating around that the star’s “love to hate” brand of popularity among viewers is so high that he will be filming a spin-off show. But is all of the gossip true?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At this point, it’s hard to say. In the meanwhile, we will have to tune into TLC to see how Big Ed’s relationship with the network develops.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Filming Secrets About 90 Day Fiancé</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhwaWWUlsZussiapZydXay1osCMoqpmmpmceqaw0mahqJpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-celebs-who-claimed-to-have-done-it-with-a-ghost.html><span>←</span><span>15 Celebs Who Claimed To Have Done It With A Ghost</span></a>
