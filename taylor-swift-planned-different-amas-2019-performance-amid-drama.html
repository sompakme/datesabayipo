And on Thursday, November 14, the “Lover” singer <a href=#>claimed that the business partners were blocking her from performing her older hits</a> on the AMAs on Sunday, November 24.</p><p>“[They] said that I’m not allowed to perform my old songs on television because they claim that would be re-recording my music before I’m allowed to next year,” she wrote on social media, referring to her plans to rerecord her past hits.</p><p>Swift, who will receive the Artist of the Decade award at the AMAs, went on: “I just want to be able to perform MY OWN music. That’s it. I’ve tried to work this out privately through my team but have not been able to resolve anything.”</p><p>An insider close to Braun sounded off on the situation to Us on Monday: “On Thursday, in her post, [Swift] said she’s been planning the performance and only ‘now’ did she hear she wasn’t allowed to perform her songs. And it was clarified as soon as the next morning she could perform whatever songs she wanted to live.”</p><p>Earlier on Monday, Big Machine announced in a statement that it <a href=#>had “come to terms” with Dick Clark Productions</a>, the production company behind the AMAs, over Swift’s performance.</p><p>“The Big Machine Label Group and Dick Clark Productions announce that they have come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms. This includes the upcoming American Music Awards performances,” the statement reads. “It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media. Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists’ audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.”</p><p>Dick Clark Productions, however, <a href=#>contested the news</a> on Monday. “At no time did Dick Clark Productions agree to, create, authorize or distribute a statement in partnership with Big Machine Label Group regarding Taylor Swift’s performance at the 2019 American Music Awards,” the company claims in its rebuttal. “Any final agreement on this matter needs to be made directly with Taylor Swift’s management team. We have no further comment.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The 2019 American Music Awards will air on ABC Sunday, November 24, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Nicholas Hautman, Marc Lupo and Brody Brown</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdpbmius2em2acmZuzpr7Ep6tmmZ2WwG5%2Bj2pwZqiVp7OwvsyapZydXZa6qrCMnamapZFk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kat-graham-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html><span>←</span><span>Kat Graham Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
