When the show first started, the two girls were still considerably young, with Kendall being eleven years old and Kylie just nine years old.</p><p>They are both now in their twenties, and it's fair to say they have both grown up a lot since the show first aired. During their time on-screen, the two girls have been connected to various romances, with some lasting longer than others.</p><h2 id=who-is-kendall-jenner-39-s-current-boyfriend>Who Is Kendall Jenner's Current Boyfriend?</h2><p>Kendall Jenner is officially dating Devin Booker, an American NBA star who plays for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association. The 25-year-old has been <a href=#>spotted on Kendall's Instagram on numerous occasions</a>, where the pair flaunt their super cute dates together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, some <a href=#>fans actually don't think that the young pair share any romantic chemistry</a> at all, and weren't afraid to share their thoughts in the comments, prompting Kendall to delete the pictures shortly after. Despite some initial 'hate', Kendall has still continued to share photos of her and her beau.</p><p>However, Devin Booker isn't the only male that Kendall has been romantically involved with. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her previous dating history</a> includes A$AP Rocky, Nick Jonas, Harry Styles, Jordan Clarkson, Blake Griffin, and Ben Simmons, with <a href=#>rumors even flying that she had a short relationship with Justin Bieber</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Harry Styles Seems Happy To Be In Kendall Jenner's 'Friend-Zone' After Their Rumored Romance">Harry Styles Seems Happy To Be In Kendall Jenner's 'Friend-Zone' After Their Rumored Romance</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Bieber later came to address the rumors in November 2015, stating that 'nothing was ever serious' between them. This still leaves a sense of mystery for many fans regarding their past relationship.</p><h2 id=is-kendall-jenner-jealous-of-ex-a-ap-rocky-39-s-relationship-with-rihanna>Is Kendall Jenner Jealous Of Ex A$AP Rocky's Relationship With Rihanna?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna and A$AP Rocky have recently welcomed a baby</a> into the world together. From 2016-2017, Kendall Jenner also dated A$AP Rocky, however, the two reportedly split due to both of them having difficult schedules.</p><p>Still, the recent baby news has fans recalling Rocky's past relationship with Kendall, and whether she's feeling some type of way about his new life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whilst Kendall seems unbothered by <strong><a href=#>Rihanna</a> </strong>and A$AP, it also seems that she doesn't feel any desire yet to have children, and it seems the reality TV star even feels pressured to do so.</p><p>In a recent episode of The Kardashians, a scene between Kendall and her mom, Kris Jenner, shows the two discussing children in her office. Kendall goes states that it's 'her life' and she doesn't know if she's ready yet and still has a lot she needs to figure out before she can welcome a child into her life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Did Justin Bieber Really Date Kendall Jenner?">Did Justin Bieber Really Date Kendall Jenner?</a></span></p><p>She also tells the cameras that she's currently enjoying life on her own and that she's okay with that right now.</p><p>So, although her family seems keen, for Kendall, kids appear to be off the cards right now, which is perfect if it suits her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-kendall-jenner-and-devin-booker-getting-serious>Are Kendall Jenner And Devin Booker Getting Serious?</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Kendall Jenner has amassed a $45 million dollar fortune, which has been built thanks to her successful reality TV and modeling career, alongside building several brands and doing online brand endorsements. Her current man is also a millionaire, and in fact dwarfs his reality star girlfriend's earnings.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, <a href=#>Devin Booker has a large net worth of $50 million</a>. Much of this is thanks to his career as a basketball player in the NBA. For his first season from 2021-2022, the 25-year-old made a whopping $31.6 million dollars and is expected to make another $5 million in his upcoming season. However, not all his money comes from his basketball career alone. The NBA star has other sources of revenue to keep his income topped up.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Did Kendall Jenner Secretly Get Engaged To Devin Booker To Avoid Pressure From Her Mother?">Did Kendall Jenner Secretly Get Engaged To Devin Booker To Avoid Pressure From Her Mother?</a></span></p><p>Devin has collaborated with sports brands such as Nike, Foot Locker and Finish Line, all of whom have no doubt paid the sports star a pretty penny for his input. The figures are likely in the millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Kendall and Devin both have busy lives, they also seem to spend plenty of time together.</p><p>Clearly, if Devin and Kendall are planning a future side by side, they have a way to go to rival Rihanna and A$AP Rocky's shared empire. But that doesn't mean Jenner is jealous of her ex at all, especially as she seems to be in no hurry to walk down the aisle or start a family.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# title="Kendall Jenner Sparks Marriage Speculation Over Snap Of Boyfriend's Ring">Kendall Jenner Sparks Marriage Speculation Over Snap Of Boyfriend's Ring</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqaUlrmtecmepaedomK3pq3LqKysZZGorrF50aiapLFdp7aprc2nmGaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBir6Ku2Gg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diane-kruger-slams-quentin-tarantino-s-casting-process.html><span>←</span><span>Diane Kruger Slams Quentin Tarantino's Casting Process</span></a>
