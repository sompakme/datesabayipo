Having put her music career to the side, the socialite began working on developing her own clothing line, which was originally titled The Reginae Carter Collection before being renamed to Shut Up by Reginae Carter.</p><p>Following the rebrand, Reginae took to her Instagram handle to share the exciting news on what fans could expect from her collection moving forward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The exciting NEW ShutUp Collection created by me, Reginae Carter @colormenae aims to SILENCE peer pressure, QUIET social media criticism, and MUTE HATERS through dope StreetWear fashion.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To Justin Bieber’s Friends, Lil Za And Lil Twist?</a></span></p><p>“It’s purpose is to make a powerful POSITIVE statement & take a stand against NEGATIVE issues facing today’s youth.”</p><p>The online fashion boutique sells all sorts of apparel on its official site and Instagram page including hoodies, shirts, jackets, accessories, and more. It can only be assumed that with her large following on social media, Reginae is probably making a considerable amount from her clothing store alone.</p><p>In 2017, she signed on to star alongside Bow Wow, Da Brat, and Jermaine Dupri in the WeTV reality show Growing Up Hip Hop: Atlanta, where she made appearances in 14 episodes before she deciding to quit after she and her mother, Toya Johnson, accused producers of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">portraying her daughter to be a spoiled brat</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’m sick of y’all making my baby look like a f****g Brat!! #GUHHATL,” said on Twitter soon after Reginae’s series had aired. “Please don’t call us to come back. We done!&nbsp;#GUHHATL.”</p><p>After her departure in 2018, Reginae signed on to star in two movies the following year: Pride & Prejudice: Atlanta, and Dear Santa, I Need a Date.</p><p>Granted, these were both two low-budget TV flicks, but it certainly showed fans that Reginae was willing to try it all. From singing to a stint on reality TV, launching a clothing line to becoming an actress — quite literally, is there anything this girl can’t do?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast And Furious: Here’s Why Eminem Turned Down Playing Brian O’Conner</a></span></p><p>And since she’s no longer tied to her former reality show, Reginae is already looking to leave Atlanta, having gushed in an interview with Page Six on her forthcoming plans to potentially <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relocate over to sunny Los Angeles</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seeing that her love life has faced many ups and downs thanks to her on-off relationship with rapper YFN Lucci, Reginae says that for her to be able to date again, she’d have to move to a new state, and California sounds right up her alley.</p><p>“It’s hard dating in Atlanta — everybody knows everybody … I definitely feel like I need to leave and go to LA; that’s like, probably the only place that I can go.”</p><p>”It is hard to decipher who’s real and who’s fake. All I can say to myself and other people is keep checking your bank account.”</p><p>Reginae is currently making appearances on VH1’s T.I. & Tiny: Friends & Family Hustle where her mother stars as a lead cast member, which seems to be an ideal situation for the 22-year-old, who pops in every now and then before she’s back to working on her brand and continuing to build a name for herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is How Much Tekashi 6ix9ine Has Earned Since His Release From Prison</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoqRdrK66usRmm5qtl53Bpr6Mq5ygoZ6Wsm6vwKurnqpdZ3qutculoKimXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./here-s-how-rhonj-margaret-josephs-amassed-her-50-million-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Heres How RHONJ Margaret Josephs Amassed Her $50 Million Net Worth</span></a>
