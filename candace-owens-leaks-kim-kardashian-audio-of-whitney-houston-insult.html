She’s nasty,” Owens said. The 33-year-old political commentator punctuated her statement by exclaiming, “It is the opposite version of the Kim Kardashian that your kids have been following,” before pressing play on the audio.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A voice comes on, which sounds very similar to Kim K, and says, “Ray, it’s Kim.” The voice in question goes on to call the “One Wish” singer disgusting before taking aim at Houston.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Honestly, go have fun with old hag Whitney Houston; she’s so sick,” the voice says. “Crack is definitely not wack with you guys. You are just, honestly, it makes me laugh how disgusting you guys look.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Though it is unclear when the voicemail was sent, the situation becomes even more layered as the internet was quick to recall how the reality TV star expressed her love for the six-time Grammy winner upon her passing in 2012 and even offered condolences to the singer’s family.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just heard the tragic news that Whitney Houston passed away.
