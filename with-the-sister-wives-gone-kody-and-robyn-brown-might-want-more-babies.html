<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>With The Sister Wives Gone, Kody And Robyn Brown Might Want More Babies</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Before <a href=#>three of Kody Brown's marriages failed</a>, it appeared that the family unit was complete. After sharing 18 children between Christine Brown, Jenelle Brown, Meri Brown, and <a href=#>Robyn Brown, also known as "the favorite wife,"</a> as well as several grandchildren, Kody seemed content with the life he created for himself. Christine, Janelle, and Meri were done having children and Robyn seemed like she could go either direction about having another baby or two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fast-forward a few years and there is no longer a compound where the families are living. Instead, it is only Kody, Robyn, and their respective younger children living together. And it turns out there may be a desire to want to expand the family that Kody and Robyn created together.</p><h2 id=kody-and-robyn-brown-have-discussed-having-more-kids>Kody And Robyn Brown Have Discussed Having More Kids</h2><p>Given that most of his children were grown or close to it, Kody thought he was done fathering any more children. In fact, Robyn and Kody came to the conclusion that it was time to be done having kids when the two took a trip to Las Vegas together.</p><p>As such, when <a href=#>the wife he is closest to</a> did an about-face, Kody was a little surprised. However, he said he would not be the one to put a kibosh on having another baby or two, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">saying that he would leave that decision to Robyn</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fotor_2023-2-1_20_13_36.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"That’s really up to her, but it’s always fun to sit here and fill my youth going, ‘I can have kids if I want to,'” Kody, explained.</p><p>“I do that to my adult children sometimes. It’s not cool to Robyn. She’s like, ‘Oh, this jerk is doing it again.’ And I’m like, ‘I can have more kids if I want to. I might have kids younger than your kids,’ stuff like that. It’s more, like, a dumb thing where I’m just challenging the kids and I’m teasing them."</p><p>As for Robyn, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a "biological clock ticking" is what led to the discussion of having more children in the first place</a>.</p><p>"I'm not getting younger," Robyn said. "We can't sit here and stall out on this if this is what we're going to do. I have days when I'm baby hungry and I really want another baby."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sister Wives' Robyn Brown Is Taking The Blame For Kody's Poor Relationships With His Kids</a></span></p><p>As such, while Kody believes that it is all up to Robyn to decide to add to their family, it will ultimately be because the two decide to do so as a couple.</p><p>"Personally, I think it’s up to Robyn," Kody explained to Us Weekly. "But whenever I ask her, she always goes, ‘Well, it’s up to us. We make this decision together'."And just what that decision will be determined sooner rather than later.</p><h2 id=robyn-brown-has-never-experienced-the-feeling-of-quot-oh-i-39-m-done-quot>Robyn Brown Has Never Experienced The Feeling Of "Oh, I'm Done"</h2><p>When the entire family was still together, Christine, Janelle, and Meri had made it clear at separate points in their lives that they were done having children. That was not a sentiment expressed by Robyn.</p><p>In fact, the way she felt was far from being done. Because of this, according to People, having more children with Kody was a possibility that was never ruled out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Women talk about that feeling of like, 'Oh, I'm done.' I've never really got that," Robyn explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/brown-1657559963795.jpg><p>The last of the sister wives to join the family went on to say, "You know when you're young and you're just thinking about having children and people will say, 'How many kids are you going to have?' I would always say, 'Just as many as I'm supposed to have. As many as I've made promises to'."</p><p>Part of the reason that Robyn is hesitant to specifically state that she is done having children is that she feels like she has met some of her children when they were in their spiritual form before they were born.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because she has had a vision of a "little dark-haired boy" on more than one occasion, the mother-of-five just wants to make sure that she is not "leaving somebody behind."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything The 'Sister Wives' Have Said About Robyn Brown And Her Relationship With Kody</a></span></p><p>"It is, it's a big deal to me," Robyn explained. "To make sure, to make sure all my babies are here with me. That's all."</p><p>"In my head, I made promises to a certain amount of children to be their mother. You know, in the pre-life and I want to fulfill all those promises."</p><p>It is because of her "spiritual children" that it is possible that Robyn will not close the door to becoming a mother again for years to come. And with the expectation that she would have more of Kody's attention when there are no distractions from other sister wives, now might just be the right time to do just that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kody-brown-and-robyn-brown-may-adopt>Kody Brown And Robyn Brown May Adopt</h2><p>Given that Robyn is in her early forties and Kody is in his fifties, they may not have as easy a time conceiving as they did in the past should they decide to have more children. As such, a possibility the two have discussed is adoption.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sister Wives' Meri Brown Might Have Wanted More Kids With Kody</a></span></p><p>"Adoption was never an option because we were having our own children. But now that we're winding up here, the idea of adoption is something that would be more appealing to me," Kody explained, according to People.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/l-intro-1611084235.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether adoption is how Robyn envisions expanding her family is unclear. She is, however, open to "God's inspiration" when it comes to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whether she and Kody are done having children</a> or if more are in their future.</p><p>"When we grow our family, it’s sort of by inspiration,” Robyn explained. “If we were blessed with more children, of course, I’d be totally open to that."</p><p>As such, the story may not be over when it comes to the number of children that Kody and Robyn have. But if the decision is made to have more, TLC may just have another hit reality series on its hands.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dp7yjxc1mmKecXaC8pcWMm6mor55itaLCyKeeZqWfp7Jut8idqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-rhobh-cast-rocked-the-2024-people-s-choice-awards-red-carpet.html><span>←</span><span>The 'RHOBH' Cast Rocked the 2024 People's Choice Awards Red Carpet</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
