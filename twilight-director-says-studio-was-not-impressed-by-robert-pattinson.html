When she viewed the footage, she had reservations about their chemistry, asking herself, “Does it really translate [to the screen]?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/%E2%80%98Twilight-Director-Says-Studio-Didnt-Think-Robert-Pattinson-Was-Hot-Enough-for-the-Franchise-2.jpg><p>After she sent the audition to the film studio, Summit Entertainment, Pattinson met the executives and they were not sold on him.</p><p>“They called me back and go, ‘Do you think you can make this guy look good?’ I said, ‘Yeah, I do. Did you see his cheekbones? We’re doing a makeover on the hair and everything and he’s going to start working out and he’s going to be gorgeous.’”</p><p>Hardwicke continued that she had to convince the execs that Pattinson was the man for the role after he failed to impress them in person.</p><p>“They didn’t believe it at first. He walked over there with a stained shirt,” she said. “It was Rob.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/%E2%80%98Twilight-Director-Says-Studio-Didnt-Think-Robert-Pattinson-Was-Hot-Enough-for-the-Franchise-3.jpg><p>Pattinson was one of four actors who were in the final running to be cast as Cullen, along with <strong>Jackson Rathbone</strong>, <strong>Ben Barnes</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Shiloh Fernandez.</strong> Eventually, he was selected, and Rathbone was featured in the film in the role of Cullen family member Jasper Hale.</p><p>Like Pattinson he also appeared in the four sequels: The Twilight Saga: New Moon in 2009, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse in 2010, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 in 2011 and The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 in 2012</p><p>Pattinson previously <a href=# rel=noopener>told W Magazine </a>that he auditioned for <a href=#>Twilight</a> after he lost a role in another film.</p><p>“I flew out to L.A. to actually audition for something else, which I was told was mine to take, just on a plate. And I went in and completely ruined the audition. And then the next day was the Twilight audition,” he said in September 2017. “I think I was at such a kind of nothing-to-lose state, it was quite easy for me to do.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Pattinson also admitted that he was not prepared to portray Cullen.</p><p>“I never really quite knew how to play a vampire, though. I sort of just was a pale, pale person,” he said and added that he was not comfortable with the abnormal plot.</p><p>“When we first signed up for it, if it hadn’t been so successful I think people would have thought it was really weird. It’s a really weird story,” Pattinson remembered. “But once it becomes mainstream, it’s difficult for people to see how strange a story is.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuwoZyetKnAjJ2gq52TqbyzedKasKxlo6nCpbXOZq6aq12jvLV5yKanq52jqLKlecGyZKunkpq%2FtXnPmqutoZ6ovK97</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vinnie-hacker-tiktok-age-height-girlfriend-parents-wiki-bio.html><span>←</span><span>Vinnie Hacker (TikTok) Age, Height, Girlfriend, Parents, Wiki, Bio</span></a>
