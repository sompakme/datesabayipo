During an <a href=#>interview with Chris Van Vliet</a>, Page explained the reasoning behind his increased appearances on ROH, revealing that it coincided with his decision to scale back on making <a href=#>YouTube content</a>.</p><p>“If I’m putting something out, it’s something that inspired me. The last time we did an interview, I was doing American Top Team stuff, things were going fantastic. Not to say that I’m not happy. I just noticed a change in my career. And I realized that I really needed to start focusing on professional wrestling more and dedicating myself to that, which is actually why I requested to do the Ring of Honor stuff, because our roster has grown so big that the opportunities to be physically active in the ring, come a lot less,” Page said.</p><p>“That’s just the nature of the beast. Tony wants to have the best wrestlers in the world. I commend them for it, we have them all, but the matches come less. So I wanted to be more active. And as I age, I started to notice that my body was starting to feel a little bit tighter. And when you’re not wrestling as often your body is just adjusting way different. So I was like, ‘Okay, dude, you’re either going to end your career by just getting stagnant and fatter and more depressed.’ I could have definitely kept continuing to do the YouTube videos and selling ads through an agency. I was doing very well and things were great. But that was kind of my full-time job, and then everything else kind of took a backseat in the trajectory of that, if that makes any sense.”</p><p>Page’s last ROH appearance occurred on the November 23 episode of ROH on HonorClub, where he defeated Tony Nese. Page returns to AEW programming this Saturday when he takes on fellow Canadian Kenny Omega on AEW Collision.</p><p><a href=#>Ethan Page Announces More Details On The Return Of Alpha-1 Wrestling</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNrbm5oYGKytbTAp2SpmZeaerOx1Z6YpatdrLWiwIymmJ2dXZ22rnnRnqiunaOpeqJ50a6lZqGeYr%2BqusZmpp9lmKS7sL4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bryce-laspisa-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Bryce Laspisa Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
