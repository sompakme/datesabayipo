"It's about everyone's right to free speech and not being told to leave a city or anything like that for something that you've said."</p><p>As members of Cornerstone showed up, some shuttled to the Chick-fil-A in buses, a crowded drive-through became even more congested. Some people told us they waited more than an hour for food.</p><p>"It was worth it, though," said another church member. "We wanted to show our support and that's exactly what we did."</p><p>While the overwhelming majority of people we spoke to supporter Cathy and Chick-fil-A, one local man told us he was disturbed by the scene at the restaurant.</p><p>"I think it's sad," said Dan Stach. "It's a gathering of people who are contributing money to somebody who wants to take away rights."</p><p>Stach said he tried to organize a last-minute rally against Chick-fil-A but it did not materialize. He's hoping to organize a protest in Salisbury on Friday, when people all over the country are planning a "Same-Sex Kiss Day."</p><p>"I'm heterosexual, so I don't think my wife wants me up here kissing any men," Stach said, jokingly. "However, I am going to try to get as many people as I can up here to try and participate in that."</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph body-copyright">WSOC</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKSfmK6te8KhoJyjXZu2rXnCqKWtqp%2BrsrO%2F2GafoqxdmLWivsuoq62dXaeytMDArqmapqSofHN%2Bkm1ra2xiZ3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-evans-and-his-dog-dodger-see-their-pawsome-friendship.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Evans and His Dog Dodger: See Their Pawsome Friendship</span></a>
