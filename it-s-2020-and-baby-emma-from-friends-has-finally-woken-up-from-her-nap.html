We are now as far away from the year 2000 as the year 2000 was from 1980. Crazy, right? Plus, all we're quickly discovering how accurate all of those time travel movies were during which characters travel to crazy futures, some of which we have already passed.</p><p>One future reference some people might have forgotten about took place during the final season of Friends. It is particularly topical right now as it was a reference to the year we have just begun, 2020. Chandler, frustrated that he and Monica can't leave Ross and Rachel's apartment due to a sleeping baby Emma, references the year during a video message to the little one.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is How Much Joey Owed Chandler By The End Of Friends</a></strong></p><p>"Hi Emma, it’s the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?" Chandler sarcastically says to the camera. Well, 17 years later and 2020 is finally here, so we have just one question. Is Emma still enjoying her nap? Thankfully she is not, as that would probably be considered less of a nap and more of a coma by this point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How do we know that Emma isn't still napping? Because one of the actors who played the baby all those years ago told us so. Noelle Sheldon, who played Emma along with her twin sister back in 2003, posted a pic of herself super-imposed in Central Perk, sporting a coffee mug with the shop's logo on it to boot. "Just woke up from the best nap of all time, happy 2020!!" Sheldon wrote alongside the photo.</p><p>As for what Sheldon is up to now, aside from napping, she and her twin sister Cali are still both actors. In fact, the two of them both starred in Jordan Peele's Us in 2019. Pretty impressive, and not many people are able to say that they're still doing the same job at 17 that they were doing before their first birthday. Now, we wonder if Monica and Chandler ever made it to Vermont...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>An 8-Year-Old Boy Was YouTube's Highest Earner In 2019</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZ2cmsOqv8iopWhqYGd9bq7Am7BmnZ2irm6y0aKcp5yjYruivI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./crowds-go-to-charlotte-area-chick-fil-a-restaurants-after-controversy-wsoc-tv.html><span>←</span><span>Crowds go to Charlotte-area Chick-fil-A restaurants after controversy WSOC TV</span></a>
