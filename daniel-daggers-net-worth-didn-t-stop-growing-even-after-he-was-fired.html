Years after the successful release of Selling Sunset (amid <a href=#>claims from some Bravo stars that the show is fake</a>), the streamer is back at it again with Buying London. While Selling Sunset is set around Los Angeles, Buying London takes all the real estate drama across the pond.</p><p>This time, the focus is on Daniel Daggers and his firm, DDRE. Much like on Selling Sunset, Daggers’ team of agents also stars on the show. Before any drama could take place onscreen though, Daggers himself had already been through some personal controversy after getting fired from a previous job. That said, this never stopped him from getting richer and ultimately becoming “Mr. Super Prime.” This article will delve into Daniel Daggers' net worth, how getting fired didn't harm it, and compare/contrast his career with that of Sellign SUnset's Jason Oppenheim.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daniel-daggers-is-one-of-the-richest-people-in-london-real-estate>Daniel Daggers Is One Of The Richest People In London Real Estate</h2><p>For a man like Daniel Daggers, the sky is the limit in real estate. And after <strong>selling over $5.5 billion in properties</strong>, Mr. Super Prime is reportedly<strong> worth an astounding £170 million (approximately $216.2 million)</strong>, based on estimates by The Tab.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/daniel-daggers-in-buying-london.jpg><p>That is rather unsurprising considering that Daggers has been growing his business interests over the years. According to the U.K. Government’s database, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>the real estate mogul is also involved in various other companies</strong></a>, including a production company which most likely supports his main business. After all, it seems that real estate will always be Daggers’ first love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tom-brady-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Tom Brady Regrets Agreeing To Netflix Roast After Seeing The Way It Hurt Ex-Wife Gisele Bundchen">Tom Brady Regrets Agreeing To Netflix Roast After Seeing The Way It Hurt Ex-Wife Gisele Bundchen</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Tom Brady is upset that the jokes about his divorce affected his children.</p><p>In fact, this real estate mogul has been selling real estate for as long as anyone can remember, having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>started in the business at the very young age of 17 back in 1997</strong></a>, according to Daggers’ LinkedIn page. Now, he may have started with a small firm, but 10 years later, Daggers made his way to the prestigious Knight Frank agency where he first joined as a senior negotiator before working his way up the career ladder.</p><p>During his time at the company, Daggers sold a lot of very expensive homes. These include a London property, which sold for a staggering £95 million (approximately $120.7 million). Daggers also revealed that he sold 13 properties from 2018 to 2019. In total, his sales for that period was estimated to be worth £246.1 million (approximately $312.71 million).</p><p>Gradually, Daggers also established himself as a real estate social media star. Just as things were looking up, however, he suddenly found himself jobless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=getting-fired-never-stopped-daniel-daggers-from-getting-richer>Getting Fired Never Stopped Daniel Daggers From Getting Richer</h2><p>For a lot of real estate agents, social media has become one of the most effective ways to market high-end properties to the people who truly need to see them. Becoming quite a social media star has also helped a lot of these agents gain more credibility in the business. And that street cred, in turn, helps them sell more real estate. That’s essentially what Daniel Daggers did.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/daniel-daggers-in-netflix-series-buying-london.jpg><p>While he was still working at Knight Frank, social media rose to fame and Daggers soon realized that he could use it to his advantage. And so, back in 2016, he started to utilize various social media platforms, including Instagram (his account, daniel_daggers, boasts of over 92,000 followers as of 2024).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, <strong>Mr. Super Prime has used his platform to promote several properties</strong> he’s selling for his previous agency. On his LinkedIn page, he even wrote about the importance of social media to his “sector” and how it became an “exceptional lead generator” in the market. At some point, however, Daggers also crossed the line.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/josh-duggar-s-messy-relationship-history-is-exposed-by-netflix-s-ashley-madison-documentary1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Josh Duggar's Messy Relationship History Is Exposed By Netflix's Ashley Madison Documentary">Josh Duggar's Messy Relationship History Is Exposed By Netflix's Ashley Madison Documentary</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Netflix's Ashley Madison docu-series further complicates Josh Duggar's controversial relationship history.</p><p>According to a report from The Real Deal, the luxury real estate agent once shared a photo of a London home that belonged to one of his clients. The problem was Daggers, who had 30,000 followers on Instagram at that time, did so without asking for permission first. Not long after that, Knight Frank announced that he would soon be leaving the company. Meanwhile, after the announcement was made, Daggers also took to Instagram to confirm that he would be on “gardening leave” for three months. He also revealed that he had resigned from his role at Knight Frank.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite this setback, Daggers was determined to keep going, opening DDRE Ltd. back in 2020. Since then, his company has become one of the leading luxury real estate firms in the market. Daggers and his team not only sell palatial homes all over the U.K., but they also have several high-end property listings around the world. On their show, Buying London, Daggers and his team even traveled to Dubai to look at some properties that they could offer their wealthy clients.</p><h2 id=how-does-daniel-daggers-compare-to-lsquo-selling-sunset-rsquo-star-jason-oppenheim>How Does Daniel Daggers Compare to ‘Selling Sunset’ Star Jason Oppenheim?</h2><p>With the popularity and success of Selling Sunset, it’s rather unavoidable for fans of the two shows to draw comparisons between Daniel Daggers and Selling Sunset’s Jason Oppenheim. Both men have found success in selling expensive properties and both know how to cater to exclusive clientele. That said, one businessman has apparently made more money than the other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/daniel-daggers-appears-on-netflix.jpg><p>Now, business may be doing well for Oppenheim, who shares his real estate business with his brother Brett (although <a href=#>he supposedly left the company already</a>). However, his wealth still doesn’t come close to Daggers with estimates indicating that the Oppenheim brothers have a net worth of $50 million each. That said, they are still the <a href=#>richest cast members of Selling Sunset</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, just as viewers have seen on their shows, both men have dealt with a lot of drama within their company. However, Daggers and Oppenheim still differ in how they approach relationships with agents who work for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/instar53436388.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Why 'Selling Sunset' Star Nicole Young Became One Of The Most Unlikeable Characters On TV">Why 'Selling Sunset' Star Nicole Young Became One Of The Most Unlikeable Characters On TV</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Fans have been begging Nicole Young to quit 'Selling Sunset'.</p><p>In Buying London, Daggers seemingly prefers to set some boundaries between himself and his agents. For instance, might have<strong> a close relationship with agent Lauren Christy</strong>, but things never get romantic between the two. On the show, Christy herself has even said that it wasn’t something she would ever consider since it might destroy her credibility in the business. At one point, the veteran agent even thought about moving to a rival firm just so she could move on from the office gossip and have a more peaceful work life.</p><p>In contrast, Selling Sunset has featured some office romance. Back in season 5, <strong>Oppenheim became romantically involved with his agent Chrishell Stause</strong> with relationship figuring heavily on the show. The two even stepped out together several times in 2021 and remained open about their romance on social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, Stause and Oppenheim called it quits after just five months together. Even after their breakup, however, Stause has remained with The Oppenheim Group. Since then, the <a href=#>relationship between the exes has been rather awkward</a>. Their romantic history was also brought up again during Season 7 of Selling Sunset. On the show, <a href=#>Stause came to blows with Mary-Lou Nurk </a>who was Oppenheim’s girlfriend at that time.</p><p>As for Daggers, it is unclear if he would ever allow himself to be in a similar situation. On the show, it also appears that Mr. Super Prime is more focused on to keep selling luxury real estate more than anything else.</p><p>In the meantime, fans can continue to catch Daggers on Netflix’s Buying London. So far, Dagger’s real estate reality show has presented quite an interesting Season 1. It also seems poised to be just as successful as Selling Sunset.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaZmrlusMCgnp6qo2K7psCMsKarrJhis6q%2BxJ1km62pnruoecuopZ2nnmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bandhunta-izzy-kids-biography-record-labels-net-worth-age-tattoos.html><span>←</span><span>Bandhunta Izzy Kids, Biography, Record Labels, Net Worth, Age, Tattoos</span></a>
