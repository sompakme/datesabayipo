The ace playmaker was born as Blake Austin Griffin to Tommy and Gail Griffin in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on the 16th of March 1989. His father is of Afro-Haitian ethnical background while his mother is of white ethnicity. As such, Blake Griffin is of mixed ethnicity comprised of Caucasian, Haitian, and African-American heritage. Also, he’s a citizen of the United States of America.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-blake-griffin></span><strong>How Tall Is Blake Griffin?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many have asked questions bordering on Blake Griffin’s height due to the continuous victory the skilled athlete has achieved in many slam dunk competitions including the Powerade Jam Fest Contest which he won while still in high school. Judging from his physical appearance, it very evident that Blake Griffin is quite a tall young man.</p><p>Well, the six-time NBA All-star stands at a magnificent height of 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m). Undoubtedly, his height has a great influence on his style of play and his performance on the court as a power forward which has bestowed him with a handful of accolades. It was as a result of his towering height that he began playing in the position of a power forward as they usually range from 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m) to 7 feet 0 inches (2.13 m) in the league.</p><p>Despite his towering height, NBA players such as Andre Drummond,&nbsp;Dwight Howard, and DeAndre Jordan are all taller than Blake Griffin as they stand at a gigantic height of 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m). But he shares the same height as Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-are-his-parents></span><strong>How Tall Are His Parents?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Blake Griffin’s dad is a former basketball player who played collegiate basketball at Northwestern Oklahoma State University before he landed the job of a head coach at Oklahoma Christian School where he coached his two sons. He is quite tall although not like his sons as he stands at a height of 6 feet 7.5 inches (2.01 m). Griffin’s mom, on the other hand, is reported to be about 5 feet 10 inches (1.77 m) tall. Then, Taylor Griffin, Blake Griffin’s elder brother who is a professional basketball player as well, is 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m) tall.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=blake-griffin-weight-and-wingspan></span> <strong>Blake Griffin </strong><strong>Weight and </strong><strong>Wingspan</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Griffin measured out well in height, he doesn’t have great arm length compared to other power forwards in the NBA including his teammate Andre Drummond. His wingspan is 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m) which have been said to be far below average for a player of his position. As a result, he has been described as an unimposing defender and shot blocker.</p><p>A player’s wingspan is an important factor in the game of basketball as it helps to determine the difference between a really good player and a really great player. It has been an advantage for power forwards in rebounding even though it is most paramount on defense where arm length plays pivotal roles in challenging or blocking of shots, obscuring offensive vision, getting steals as well as denying passes.</p><p>As a result of Blake Griffin’s below-average wingspan, he has never averaged one block per game in his whole NBA career, while DeAndre Jordan whose wingspan is 7 feet 6 inches (2.29 m) has averaged 1.8 blocks per game thus far. Notwithstanding, Griffin stands out on other measurements such as vertical leap (35.5 inches) and strength, having been ranked as the 5th strongest player drafted since they began taking the measurement.</p><p>Blake Griffin’s height is very perfect for what he weighs. The 2009 AP Player of the year has maintained a great physique which has influenced his performance so far. Hence, Blake Griffin has a fine-toned body build that weighs about 113 kg (249 lb).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHq1rculZKKrXZe5orfEZp6roZabtq95wKebZq%2BYlsFurdGeZKGho2LEprXGoatmnaSdu6qvyK2waA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hilary-duff-s-pregnancy-photos-before-welcoming-4th-baby.html><span>←</span><span>Hilary Duff's Pregnancy Photos Before Welcoming 4th Baby</span></a>
