That’s how I found out about it,” Christine, 51, said during a joint <a href=# rel=noopener>People</a> interview with husband <strong>David Woolley</strong> on Wednesday, January 31. “I’m just happy for her. So happy for her. That is absolutely awesome. I’m just thrilled for her to be able to be in a romantic relationship.”</p><p>Meri, 53,<a href=#> debuted her romance</a> with boyfriend <strong>Amos</strong> via Instagram last month.</p><p>“Meet Amos, the good looking guy I’ve been dating since October! He’s not 6 foot 6, nor is he a pilot, but he loves Christmas almost as much as I do, and we laugh a lot together, both of which are important elements to a relationship,” she captioned several photos of the pair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Christine-Brown-Found-Out-About-Meris-New-BF-Through-Social-Media-%E2%80%98Thrilled-for-Her3.jpg><p>Meri and Christine were both previously married to <strong>Kody Brown</strong>. Meri and Kody, 55, were spiritually married until 2022 — they were legally married from 1990 to 2014 — while Christine and Kody were spiritually married from 1994 to 2021. Kody has also split from ex-wife <strong>Janelle Brown</strong> but remains married (legally and spiritually) to <strong>Robyn Brown</strong>.</p><p>Christine added on Wednesday that she’s happy Meri has found a love similar to the one she’s found with Woolley, 49, whom <a href=#>she wed</a> in October 2023.</p><p>“It’s just really an incredible thing to feel like you are loved more than anybody else,” she said. “David loves me more than anybody else. I love him more than anybody else. It really is a powerful thing to know that you really have your person.”</p><p>While Christine is happy for her former sister wife, the duo recently butted heads over a story about Meri and Kody’s wedding rings. During a December 2023 episode of Sister Wives, Christine revealed that Kody melted down his wedding ring from his union with Meri and saved the gold.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Christine-Brown-Found-Out-About-Meris-New-BF-Through-Social-Media-%E2%80%98Thrilled-for-Her7.jpg><p>Meri <a href=#>slammed Christine’s decision</a> to share the story during part 2 of Sister Wives: 1 on 1, which aired later that month.</p><p>“I am extremely frustrated right now. Beyond,” Meri said while getting choked up. “That is my story to tell when, where and how I want to. And somebody else took it upon themselves to tell that story. And now I’m being forced to talk about it. I’m not happy about it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite the drama, Meri noted elsewhere in the Sister Wives tell-all that she had no hard feelings about not being invited to Christine and Woolley’s wedding.</p><p>“I’m OK with it, because a wedding is a very special moment that you don’t want to have any issues [at],” she said. “They’re not going to want — and I would not want — to bring that kind of conflict of emotion into Christine’s wedding. Like, I would not want that for her. So, I’m truly OK with that.”</p><p>While Meri did not attend the nuptials, Janelle, 54, was there to support Christine and Woolley. Robyn, 45, and Kody <a href=#>didn’t make the guest list</a> either, but five of Christine and Kody’s six children were present: son Paedon, 25, and daughters Aspyn, 28, Mykelti, 27, Ysabel, 20, and Truely, 13. The former couple’s daughter Gwendlyn, 22, and her wife, <strong>Beatriz Queiroz</strong>, did not make it to the event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewLW1zZ5km6qfrLtutMSaqZ1lkZe8tsCMppyroaNiu6bDjJumsp6inrKvsIyfqailXai8pLXApWSmnZSernA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-pine-steps-into-the-spotlight-shocking-fans-who-wondered-what-happened-to-him.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Pine Steps Into The Spotlight, Shocking Fans Who Wondered What Happened To Him</span></a>
