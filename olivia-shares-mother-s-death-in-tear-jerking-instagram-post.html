Diagnosed with the early stages of the disease in 2014, Cleaver spent the following years fighting an upward battle. “By 2016 my mom was drastically losing weight and could hardly do regular things on her own,” Olivia said. “My dad is the epitome of true love and humbleness. He took such great care of her in sickness and in health.”</p><p>In remembering her final birthday celebration on Aug. 23, Olivia commemorated the beauty of her mother’s life and asked the Lord for his guidance in navigating this difficult time.</p><p>“I know she is in a better place, with her Lord & Savior and no more suffering,” Olivia said. “But I do not know what to do without her. Please pray for me and my family. Lord help us through.”</p><p>Prior to&nbsp;the Instagram announcement, Olivia turned to Twitter to share her loss with fans on Oct. 28. “Please keep me & my family in your prayers” she wrote on the social media platform. “[My dad] misses his wife & I miss my mom. Lord help us through.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Hey guys. I have been completely distraught & heartbroken these past few weeks. My beautiful mom left this earth on October 9.
