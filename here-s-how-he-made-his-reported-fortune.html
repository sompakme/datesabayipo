Hart saw how the famous movie producer went on to build his very own 300-acre studio in Atlanta. With the way things have been going for Kevin, including his successful run in the filmmaking industry, he's well on his way to reaching Perry's status. So, exactly how has Hart managed to push his net worth to $150 million in such a short amount of time? Here's all you need to know:</p><h2 id=he-charges-hollywood-studios-to-promote-their-movies-on-social-media><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>He Charges Hollywood Studios To Promote Their Movies On Social Media</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2014, leaked emails between several execs at Sony revealed how Kevin charged the studio a fee if they wanted him to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">promote their movies</a> on his social media platform.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kevin argued that, while he was paid to appear in their films, he was not paid for promotion work on social media. He’s now believed to make a fortune from Hollywood studios because he has such a large following.</span></p><h2 id=his-comedy-tours-gross-millions-in-revenue><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>His Comedy Tours Gross Millions In Revenue</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kevin makes an impressive sum when it comes to his comedy tours. His estimated earnings per show - in 2016 alone - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stood at $1 million</a>, but given his growing stardom, there’s no doubt that those figures have increased by now.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fans love to see Kevin put on an exhilarating show and they are willing to pay big bucks to be there.</span></p><h2 id=he-starred-in-many-tv-shows-before-hitting-it-big-time><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>He Starred In Many TV Shows Before Hitting It Big Time</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before his big shot at the box office, Kevin made a name for himself outside of comedy, by starring in several popular TV shows. He proved he was a talented actor when he starred in BET’s Real Husbands of Hollywood, alongside Nick Cannon, Robin Thicke, and Nelly, to name a few.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He also appeared in The Next Level, All Of Us, and Hart of the City.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-once-had-a-lucrative-endorsement-deal-with-h-amp-m><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>He Once Had A Lucrative Endorsement Deal With H&M</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2016, Kevin signed a deal with H&M for a hilarious spoof campaign which saw the comedian promoting a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very unlikely stage show</a> with the British soccer player, David Beckham. The commercial was associated with the new range of Modern Essentials from the fashion brand.

Since then, Kevin has not only filmed several stand-up shows for Netflix, he has also partnered with them for his limited docu-series, Don’t F--- This Up.</span></p><h2 id=he-s-previously-partnered-with-the-nba-and-mountain-dew><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He’s Previously Partnered With The NBA And Mountain Dew</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kevin announced his partnership with the NBA and Mountain Dew in an interview with Forbes, but he went on to stress that he’s not the type to simply attach his name to anything.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Hart explained: “One thing I don’t ever want to do is NASCAR myself out; for people to say, ‘He’s got a Samsung deal and now an AT&T deal and then a new loafer deal and then a Wrangler deal?'”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“To sit here and say money doesn’t play a part in some deals, you wouldn’t be telling the truth.

On Instagram alone, he has 85.5 million followers, while his Twitter and Facebook accounts have followings of 36.1 million and 23 million, respectively.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>With everything combined, Kevin has a social media reach that is unheard of for a comedian.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-commonly-signs-back-end-deals-for-his-movies><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Commonly Signs Back-End Deals For His Movies</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now that Kevin is an A-list actor, he can <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">negotiate back-end deals</a> on top of the money he’s already expected to receive for starring in a movie. While it was never revealed how much Hart made for his role in Jumanji: Welcome 2 The Jungle, the father-of-three did sign a back-end agreement, which would see him earn an additional amount if the movie was a success.

That’s right, the trend that Paris Hilton famously started still lives on to this day - celebrities are still getting paid to party, but the fees are generally higher than what they used to be.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, someone as famous as Kevin can charge a minimum of $100,000 for a quick appearance.</span></p><h2 id=his-production-company-is-becoming-a-major-competitor-in-hollywood><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>His Production Company Is Becoming A Major Competitor in Hollywood</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Hart owns his very own entertainment company called Hartbeat Productions, which has already produced several hit films, including 2018’s Night School, starring Tiffany Haddish, and the theatrical comedy special, Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He plans to keep it growing with several major projects, including TV and movies that are already in the works, right through to 2022.</span></p><h2 id=he-has-starred-in-commercials-for-endless-brands><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Has Starred In Commercials For Endless Brands</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2017, it was revealed that Kevin, who was named the sixth highest-paid comedian, had made 20% of his income from branded partnerships alone. Brands he was endorsed by at the time included Nike and Tommy John (who has repeatedly worked with K-Hart on several campaigns).
