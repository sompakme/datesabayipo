Given White's advanced age at the time, nobody could be shocked by her passing. However, when reports started to come out about what happened to White's estate, it took many observers by surprise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Did-Betty-Whites-Stepchildren-Like-Her-As-Much-As-The-Rest-Of-The-World-Did_.jpg><p>After getting together in the '60s, Betty White and her final husband, Allen Ludden, were married for nearly two decades. The couple's marriage only ended when Ludden passed away. While White never gave birth during her life, she was a stepmother to Ludden's three children.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who were Betty White's husbands</a>, according to Who's Dated Who?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Husband:</p></td><td><p>When They Married:</p></td><td><p>When Their Marriage Ended:</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dick Barker</p></td><td><p>7th Jul 1945</p></td><td><p>Divorced on 18th Dec 1945</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lane Allen</p></td><td><p>1947</p></td><td><p>Divorced in 1949</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Allen Ludden</p></td><td><p>14th Jun 1963</p></td><td><p>Ludden passed away on June 9, 1981</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to reports, White had a close relationship with her stepchildren despite early tensions between the actor and their biological mother. According to a 2020 Closer Weekly report, White planned to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">include her stepchildren in plans for her 98th birthday party that year</a>.</p><p>Given that White remained on good terms with her stepchildren, it would have made sense if she left her estate to them. However, if the reports are accurate, White at the very least didn't leave the majority of her fortune to her stepkids.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/did-cher-win-millions-of-dollars-from-sonny-bono-s-estate-after-his-tragic-ski-accident_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Cher Win Millions Of Dollars From Sonny Bono's Estate After His Tragic Ski Accident?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Decades after Sonny Bono's passing, his ex-wife Cher sued his widow Mary Bono for a fortune.</span><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Betty White's estate is valued at $75 million</a>. That means that White left behind a lot of resources that seemingly have been used to support the causes she cared about deeply during her life.</p><p>In December 2022, The Daily Star published an article about White's estate that was updated in December 2023. As that report makes clear, the exact details of White's estate plan have never been publicly divulged.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/betty-white-smiling.jpg><p>Even though it is impossible to be certain about where White's money has gone, it is widely believed that she left most of it to charities. Citing unnamed sources, The Daily Star concluded that was where White's money went.</p><p>"Despite the official documents remaining private, various sources have speculated on where Betty’s money ended up. One source claimed that, though Betty’s family and friends will be taken care of, most of her estate went to her dogs."</p><p>Since The Daily Star cited unnamed sources and the publication is questionable, it makes sense to take that report with a grain of salt. However, more credible sources have published reports that back up what The Daily Star claimed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/anna-nicole-smith-looking-mischievous.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Anna Nicole Smith Battled The Son Of Her Dead Billionaire Husband For Most Of His Estate, Here's How Much She Won</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Anna Nicole Smith spent years fighting to get a piece of her billionaire husband J.

According to reports, it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">White's home in Carmel, California that reportedly meant more</a> to the actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/betty-white-posing.jpg><p>"White, who passed away on Friday morning <a href=#>,</a> lived in a five-bedroom, six-bathroom Brentwood home, located in West Los Angeles.
