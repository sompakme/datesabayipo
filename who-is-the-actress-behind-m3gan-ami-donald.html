Directed by Gerard Johnstone, this horror movie stars a robotic doll that's programmed to be any child's greatest friend, that is, until she goes on a killing spree. What’s there not to love?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even before the movie came out, the internet couldn’t stop talking about this robotic doll that’s set to become everyone’s favorite killer doll. First, this killer doll became a meme because of her dancing moves. Then, fans couldn’t get enough of her <a href=# rel=nofollow>feud with another fan-favorite creepy doll</a>, Chucky. But who exactly is the young actress that plays M3GAN, Amie Donald?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>From ‘Chucky’ To ‘Annabelle’: Why Are Doll Horror Movies So Creepy?</a></span></p><h2 id=m3gan-became-an-internet-sensation-since-the-trailer-for-this-movie-first-came-out>M3GAN Became An Internet Sensation Since The Trailer For This Movie First Came Out</h2><p>Produced by Blumhouse Production and Universal Studios, M3GAN was released in theaters just this week. The movie follows Gemma (<a href=# rel=nofollow>Allison Williams</a>), an engineer and programmer who creates the perfect toy for her niece Cady (Violet McGraw): a life-like doll called M3GAN, which is short for Model 3 Generative Android.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the trailer suggests, this creepy-looking robotic doll is willing to do anything to protect Cady, even if it means going on a killing spree.</p><p>Originally, this movie was excepted to make between $17 and $20 million during its opening weekend, but much to everyone’s surprise, M3GAN has made <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">over $45 million</a> at the box office since its premiere three days ago. Of course, this is a great start for the $12 million-budgeted movie.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Why Allison Williams Kept Turning Down Blumhouse Movies Until M3GAN Came Along</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to commercial success, M3GAN has proven to be a critical success too. The film already has an approval rating of 94% based on 171 reviews from critics and an audience score of 79% on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. The website's critical consensus reads, "Unapologetically silly and all the more entertaining for it, M3GAN is the rare horror-comedy that delivers chuckles as effortlessly as chills." It seems that this horror movie did live up to its hype.</p><h2 id=where-you-rsquo-ve-seen-the-cast-of-m3gan-before>Where You’ve Seen The Cast Of M3GAN Before</h2><p>Unlike other horror movies, M3GAN has a rather small cast. It stars <a href=# rel=nofollow>Allison Williams </a>and Violet McGraw, with Amie Donald physically portraying M3GAN and Jenna Davis voicing the character. The supporting cast consists of Brian Jordan Alvarez, Jack Cassidy, Ronny Chieng, Lori Dungey, Amy Usherwood, Stephane Garneau-Monten, Arlo Green, and Kira Josephson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Allison Williams, who plays Gemma, the toy-company roboticist that created M3GAN, has appeared in numerous movies and TV shows. Some of the most popular projects this actress has appeared in include <a href=# rel=nofollow>Netflix’s A Series of Unfortunate Events</a>, The Mindy Project, and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jordan Peele’s Get Out</a> (2017).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>What The Cast Of M3GAN Has Said About The Horror Movie</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, the young actress who plays Cady, Violet McGraw, has a very impressive resume for her age. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, she has 18 acting credits so far, which include movies like Ready Player One (2018) and Black Widow (2021). Plus, she’s appeared in other popular horror movies and TV shows like Doctor Sleep (2019) and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Netflix’s The Haunting of Hill House</a> (2018).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-the-young-actress-playing-m3gan>Who Is The Young Actress Playing M3GAN?</h2><p>If you’ve already watched, you’ve probably wondered how they brought this creepy killer doll to life for the movie. Unlike other dolls used for horror films, M3GAN is portrayed by an actor. Amie Donald physically portrayed M3GAN, but Jenna Davis is the one who ultimately voiced this doll.</p><p>Amie Donald, originally from New Zealand, had only appeared in Netflix’s Sweet Tooth before starring in M3GAN. In addition to acting, Amie has a fairly successful career as a dancer, which came in handy when filming this horror film. Surely, after the success of M3GAN, we will get to see this young actress in more projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwMeeZJqbpKeytL%2BMm5yhoZ6Zeq5%2FxpqlZpmdnnqlu82ao51n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-really-happened-between-lauren-conrad-and-heidi-montag.html><span>←</span><span>What Really Happened Between Lauren Conrad And Heidi Montag?</span></a>
