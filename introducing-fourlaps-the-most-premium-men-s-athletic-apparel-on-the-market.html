Fourlaps was not kidding around with comfort when they introduced their Lead Sherpa Reversible Jacket and <a href=# rel=noopener>Expanse Sherpa Hoodie</a>.</p><p>The Reversible Sherpa Jacket is not only wind-resistant, water-resistant and warm with a 100% biodegradable shell, but it’s two jackets in one.</p><p>If you want a more casual look, flip your jacket to the cozy sherpa side. If you’re ready for a morning hike with a friend, the water-resistant nylon layer is perfect to endure the weather and keep you warm.</p><p>For color, you can go classic with the all-black sherpa option or go for a navy and red reversible switch up. The beauty of the Reversible Sherpa Jacket is that you don’t have to choose comfort, over performance, over style — you get everything you want in the price of one jacket, doubling as two.</p><p>The Expanse Sherpa Hoodie is soft and lightweight so that you can layer up on a cold night, wear it from the gym to the store and take it on your weekend getaway. Fourlaps uses 88% sustainable materials and commits to making that number 100% by 2024. This brand is highly aware of its environmental impact and hopes to give back to the earth by ensuring that their clothing doesn’t end up in landfills.</p><p>The Sherpa Hoodie is the perfect mix between a sustainably conscious choice, a comfortable athletic staple and the sleek outerwear piece you can sport after your workout.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Buy this jacket here for the most versatile option out there.</a></p><h2>Runner’s World Named This Short Their Favorite!</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The Bolt Short</a> is built to support the track treaders, trail-blazers, beach joggers and roadrunners. With redefining comfort technology, this short stretches and flexes with your every movement. Whether you’re training or competing, the Bolt Short keeps you cool with a temperature-regulating, laser-cut ventilation system and a lightweight polyester and spandex material.</p><p>You can grab the Bolt Short in up to ten colors, including army, charcoal or camo, and you can easily pair it with any of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Fourlap Radius Tees</a>. This short and shirt combo will help support you in that timed mile, final incline or intense training session, and it will carry you seamlessly to your next activity — whether that’s a coffee run or lunch with the coworkers.</p><p>Both the Bolt Shorts and the Radius Tee are made with moisture-wicking fabric, so you don’t have to worry about your sweat, and can easily optimize your workout in comfort. When you head out or head home after your workout, you can stow your phone and stash your keys in the front and back zip pockets on the Bolt Short.</p><p>If you’re exercising early in the morning or late at night and you need that extra layer, simply pack a <a href=# rel=noopener>Rush Pullover</a> in your <a href=# rel=noopener>Fourlaps Signature Duffel Bag</a> to complete the whole look and stay warm. This soft pullover made of french terry fabric, designed to keep you cozy for a warm-up, after a winter run and when you’re out and about on the weekends. With a thumbhole design to keep sleeves from bunching and fabric as soft as cashmere, this pull-over is functional and luxe all at once.</p><p>Between the Bolt Short, the Radius Tee and the Rush Pullover, you’re all set for a productive, comfortable and eye-catching workout.</p><h2>Keeping Your Momentum Over The Winter</h2><p>The holidays always bring joy, love, family and good food.
