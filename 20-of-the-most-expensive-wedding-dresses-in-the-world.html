She thinks about who she will marry, what her ring will be like, but most of all she dreams of her dress.</p><p>Weddings, in today’s society, have become so much more than a man and a woman starting their lives together. It has become a slight cooperation that has completely evolved into something other than the celebration of love.&nbsp;Weddings have now, sadly, become about the venue, the food and most importantly the dress.</p><p>There have been so many stunning wedding dresses over the years that it is hard to narrow it down. Instead, I thought it would be fun to find out which celebrities had the most expensive wedding dresses.</p><p>When you are a person of wealth, your wedding budget is apparently a bit larger than the rest of us common folk and I can assure you that the cost of some of these dresses will make you cringe.</p><p>From big-name designers to the most expensive materials, these are the most expensive celebrity wedding dresses of all time and I bet you won't believe how much number 1 costs!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=armani-dress---50-000>Armani Dress - $50,000</h2><p><a href=#>Katie Holmes</a> and <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> had one of those relationships that the entire world was talking about.&nbsp;Holmes and Cruise got married in 2006 and although the couple got divorced, it is said that they had quite an epic wedding.</p><p>Holmes has always been a well-dressed woman which is why I know that so many people were anxiously awaiting to see what she would wear on her big day.</p><p>Holmes walked down the aisle in an Armani Dress that was covered in Swarovski Crystals. Rumor is that it took 350 hours to cover the dress with the crystals.&nbsp;The dress is said to be worth about 50 thousand dollars.</p><h2 id=helen-rose---50-000><strong>helen rose - $</strong><strong>50,000</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Elizabeth Taylor</a> is known to appreciate the finer things life has to offer. She is also known as someone who loved getting married.</p><p>I can see why someone liked her enjoyed the glitz and glamour that is attached to a wedding.&nbsp;In 1950, Taylor walked down the aisle for the first time. She wore a 50 thousand dollar gown, which was designed custom for her by Helen Rose.</p><p>In 2013, that same dress was auctioned off for 188,175 US dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=badgley-mischka---50-000>Badgley Mischka - $50,000</h2><p><a href=#>Tori Spelling</a> is what I like to call, Hollywood royalty. She is the daughter of <a href=#>Aaron and Candy Spelling</a> and she herself is an actress.&nbsp;Spelling’s most iconic role is without a doubt her role on Beverly Hills 90210 where she played Donna Martin.</p><p>Spelling’s first wedding to Charlie Shanian was spectacular. The actress walked down the aisle in a stunning Badgley Mischka dress that was worth about 50 thousand dollars.</p><p>The marriage may not have been a success, however, the dress certainly was!</p><h2 id=lawrence-steele---50-000>Lawrence Steele - $50,000</h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> is one of America’s all-time favorite ladies.&nbsp;When the actress married actor <a href=#>Brad Pitt,</a> everyone was dying to know what she was wearing and boy was it worth the wait.</p><p>Aniston wore a phenomenal Lawrence Steele gown to her wedding in 2000. The dress is said to have been worth about 50 thousand dollars.&nbsp;Sadly for all of us, the marriage did not work, however, I know a lot of us still have hope for these two to get back together one day.</p><h2 id=giles-deacon---52-000>Giles Deacon - $52,000</h2><p><a href=#>Pippa Middleton </a>is the stunning sister of our favorite royal <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>. Her beauty and elegance is remarkable and has gotten a lot of attention in the past few years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I know everyone remembers that when Kate got married, Pippa kind of stole the show. So when it came her time to walk down the aisle, I know the world could not wait to see what she would wear.</p><p>Middleton, who married James Matthews wore a Giles Deacon gown that is worth 52 thousand dollars.&nbsp;Middleton may have been wearing a 52,000$ dress but she looked like a million bucks in that gown!</p><h2 id=baracci-beverly-hills---58-000>Baracci Beverly Hills - $58,000</h2><p>Love her or hate her, there is no denying that Real Housewife <a href=#>Kim Zolciak</a> knows the finer things in life.&nbsp;The reality star is known for her outspoken, witty and over the top personality.</p><p>In 2011, she married the love of her life, Kroy and in typical Zolciak style, she had not one, not two but three gowns on her wedding day.&nbsp;The most expensive of the bunch was a 58 thousand dollar, a 32-pound gown designed by Baracci Beverly Hills.</p><p>The dress is not really my particular taste but hey, it was her wedding day, not mine.</p><h2 id=grace-kelly-inspired---60-000><strong>grace kelly inspired - $60,000</strong></h2><p>Keely Shaye Smith is married to one of the biggest hunks in show business, <a href=#>Pierce Brosnan</a>.&nbsp;Keely is a journalist, author, correspondent and at one time a model and actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the pair exchanged “I do’s” in 2001 she was wearing a Grace Kelly-inspired gown that was worth about 60 grand.</p><p>I think she looked stunning that day and I love how they are still together today. It shows that some relationships can last in Hollywood, it may be harder but it can work!</p><h2 id=helen-rose---60-000><strong>helen rose - $60,000</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Grace Kelly</a> is the epitome of class and of course, grace.</p><p>The stunning vision has been a style icon since forever and her wedding dress remains till this day a huge inspiration for many brides.</p><p>The iconic dress was designed by Helen Rose and it was worth about 60 thousand dollars.</p><p>Oscar de la Renta stated on her wedding day, Grace Kelly gave new meaning to the word "icon” and I could not agree with him more.</p><h2 id=gina-fratini---62-500>Gina Fratini -&nbsp;$62,500</h2><p>As I said before, Elizabeth Taylor got married a few times and had a really pricey taste.</p><p>At her second wedding to Richard Burton (yes, she married him twice) she wore a gorgeous Gina Fratini dress, which was auctioned off for $62,500.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The dress was unique and colorful and is seen in the world of fashion as a pretty iconic dress. It was bright yellow and she carried a yellow bouquet and had a hair full of beautiful white flowers.</p><h2 id=valentino---77-000>valentino&nbsp;- $77,000</h2><p><a href=#>Nicky Hilton</a> is one of the heirs to the Hilton fortune.&nbsp;The sister of <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a> has always been around luxury items and when it came to her wedding dress, it did not surprise anyone that she wore an extravagantly expensive gown.</p><p>Hilton graced the aisle in a drop-dead Valentino gown worth about 77,000$.&nbsp;Hilton truly looked like a royal princess in this gown and I believe it will go down in history as an incredibly iconic look.</p><h2 id=iconic-fashion---81-250><strong>iconic fashion - $81,250</strong></h2><p>In 1985, Madonna married one of the most brilliant actors of our time, <a href=#>Sean Penn</a>. Although they did not last, I always have and always will love these two great talents together.</p><p>The wedding gown Madonna wore was different, edgy and classic like her. She paired it with a black hat and white veil making it one of my most loved wedding looks of all time.</p><p>That exact wedding dress, which is known as an iconic piece of fashion history, was auctioned off in 2014 for 81,250 dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chanel---50-000><strong>chanel - $50,000</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Keira Knightley</a> is no stranger to beautiful dresses. The actress has walked countless red carpets; so for her first wedding, she knew she had to wear something jaw-dropping.</p><p>Knightley opted for a Chanel Dress which she had already had hanging in her closet. The dress was adorable and suited her personality.</p><p>What fans did not know is that she had a second ceremony where she wore a stunning Valentino gown that was estimated at 50 thousand dollars. That is more than most weddings cost as a whole.</p><h2 id=christian-lacroix---140-000>Christian Lacroix - $140,000</h2><p>Catherine Zeta-Jones is gorgeous, talented and full of style.</p><p>To me, Zeta-Jones gives off an air of royalty, which is something I absolutely love about her.&nbsp;She always looks so put together and on point and her wedding day was no exception to that rule.</p><p>Catherine Zeta-Jones said "I do" to long-time husband Michael Douglas wearing a $140,000 Christian Lacroix gown that both turned heads and turned iconic.&nbsp;Zeta-Jones looked like a royal angel on her wedding day and her timeless dress is a choice I am sure she does not regret.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vera-wang---140-000>Vera Wang - $140,000</h2><p>When you are the daughter of a Formula One billionaire, your dress budget will probably be non-existent.</p><p>Petra Ecclestone had one of the most elaborate weddings of all time. Ecclestone’s wedding is said to have been about 20 million dollars and her dress was just a tiny fraction of that cost.</p><p>Ecclestone wore a Vera Wang gown that ran up a 140 thousand dollar tab, pocket change for her!&nbsp;The reality is, she truly looked beautiful in that gown on her wedding day and although it had a big price tag, the beauty she felt in the dress is priceless.</p><h2 id=valentino---225-000>Valentino - $225,000</h2><p>When you are a real-life princess, you need to go all out for your wedding day.</p><p>Marie-Chantal Miller, the Crown Princess of Greece wore a custom Valentino gown, which was encrusted in pearls.</p><p>The dress took a team of 25 people to make and it is worth an estimated $225,000.</p><p>Her dress was literally made for the princess that she is and the detail that went into it is breathtaking. This dress may have been made for a princess but it is really fit for a queen!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=valentino---250-000>Valentino - $250,000</h2><p><a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> is a self-proclaimed diva.&nbsp;The iconic singer is known for many things and one of them is her failed relationship. Although Carey and James Packer never actually got married Carey had already bought a 250,000$ Valentino gown.</p><p>The rumor is that the singer lit the gown on fire in one of her music videos, talk about burning money!&nbsp;Carey has and will always be an icon, however, her dress will sadly never make it to the icon list! At least the one above did!</p><h2 id=alexander-mcqueen---380-000>Alexander McQueen - $380,000</h2><p>For<a href=#> George Clooney </a>to finally settle down, the world knew that Amal was&nbsp;someone special.&nbsp;Amal Almunddin, also known as Amal Clooney had, in my opinion, the nicest wedding dress on this list.</p><p>Almunddin looked like a dream in her $380,000 Alexander McQueen by Sarah Burton custom gown.&nbsp;The couple had a 4.6 million dollar budget and their wedding&nbsp;was said to be one of the most spectacular events of all time. I am devastated that my invitation got lost in the mail.</p><h2 id=alexander-mcqueen---400-000>Alexander McQueen - $400,000</h2><p><a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> became a household name almost overnight.&nbsp;The now royal married Prince Williams and they had a big, beautiful, royal wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every designer in the world wanted to dress her and she opted for a $400,000 Alexander McQueen by Sarah Burton dress and it is safe to say she made the right choice.</p><p>Middleton looked breathtaking in the gown and women all around the world tried to mimic her wedding look, however, no one pulled it off quite as well as she did.</p><h2 id=givenchy---500-000>Givenchy - $500,000</h2><p>Leave it to Reality Television Royalty to outdo real royalty. When it comes to reality Royalty, the Kardashian family is at the top of the list.</p><p><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, who is probably the most successful reality star ever wore a&nbsp;five hundred thousand dollar Ricardo Tisci for Givenchy gown to her wedding.&nbsp;As if that price tag was not enough, she paired the gown with 40,000$ Balmain heels.&nbsp;Her dress was just like her, beautiful, classic, and way overpriced!</p><h2 id=swarovski---1-million><strong>Swarovski - $1 million</strong></h2><p>Victoria Swarovski is an Australian singer who is also the heiress to the Swarovski crystal fortune.&nbsp;Swarovski takes the cake when it comes to the most expensive wedding dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This heiress walked down the aisle in what was rumored to be a 1 million dollar dress.</p><p>The gown was embellished with 500,000 crystals and worth more money then most people earn in their lifetime.&nbsp;I must say, she really did look breathtaking in that dress and truly looked like a princess.</p><p>References: MarieClaire</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5FpZKieXam1pnnMqKqtZZWtvaa60qKtnmWnmrGltc2gZJ2qlajApr%2BMoqVmrJiaeri70aWbaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-elijah-judd-of-wynonna-and-what-does-he-do-for-a-living.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Elijah Judd of Wynonna and What Does He Do For a Living?</span></a>
