But there’s still so much you don’t know about her.

My first TV job was [1986’s] A Case of Deadly Force. I had only done theater up until then and didn’t know I had to learn my lines at home. The director had to shut down the set for two hours while I was sent to my trailer to [memorize]. Never did that again.</p><p>3. I have very few friends, but the ones I do have are precious.</p><p>4. I’m a very good cook. I don’t like using cookbooks because I don’t like reading instructions.</p><p>5. I grew up not knowing I was Black. I figured it out when I moved to America. I still forget, but the world never fails to remind me.</p><p>6. I have a major love affair with Ireland and would live there full-time if I could.</p><p>7. I live on a farm in a very old house. I cannot live away from nature. It’s not a luxury for me, it’s a necessity.</p><p>8. I have a fascination with nun culture. I am dying to play [one].</p><p>9. I am [also] obsessed with vampire culture.</p><p>10. I am no stranger to loss. My house burned down in the [California wildfires] two years ago. I lost everything. It was devastating.</p><p>11. I have never earned a penny in any other “real” job except acting. It’s all I have ever done.</p><p>12. I speak sheep. When I baa, they come running.</p><p>13. My father is one of 18 children, [and] those 18 had 21 [kids]. I have thousands of cousins, [but] I am an only child.</p><p>14. I am a closet landscape designer. I have secretly designed beautiful gardens for friends.</p><p>15. I was [once] a credentialed spiritual therapist.</p><p>16. I pretty much never lie — not even little white lies.</p><p>17. In addition to acting, I will probably spend the rest of my life writing novels and short stories.</p><p>18. I was extremely androgynous until my mid-20s. I regularly shaved my head and I had no curves.</p><p>19. When I was born, I [came out] butt first, and then I pooped. That tells you a lot about my personality.</p><p>20. I learned to drive a week after I moved out to Los Angeles when I was 30. The first trip I took in the car alone was over a steep and precariously winding Laurel Canyon. I was going to an audition. I had to turn around and drive back over the canyon again because I sweat through all my clothes. No one drove with me for six months.</p><p>21. I love being a mother more than any other aspect of myself.</p><p>22. I am a tea fanatic.</p><p>23. I wanted to be a violinist, and played the violin until I started failing in school.</p><p>24. I wear only white in my private life. I started wearing [it] about 10 years ago, and now it’s just a uniform.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. I secretly want to be a singer, like <strong>Dianne Reeves</strong>. I am hoping [for that] in my next life.</p><p>The Equalizer reboot premieres on CBS Sunday, February 7 at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalp6Knrqq6xGarqK2jqK6qutNmaW5lpJ22r7PSZrCorV2ZvK%2FAjKSlqK9dlq%2BwwdNmpJ5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-rowland-margot-robbie-and-more-stun-at-babylon-premiere.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly Rowland, Margot Robbie and More Stun at 'Babylon' Premiere</span></a>
