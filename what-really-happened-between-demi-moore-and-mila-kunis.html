But there was a time when his personal life wasn’t always so rosy. Ashton was married to Demi Moore from 2005 to 2013, despite her being 15 years his senior. But <a href=#>the couple’s marriage came to a dramatic end</a>, which resulted in various allegations being thrown around even years after their highly publicized split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ashton began dating Mila before his divorce from Demi was finalized. Though Demi announced her intention to divorce in 2011, <a href=#>it wasn’t until the following year that Ashton filed paperwork</a>, after he began dating Mila. This led to intense speculation about the timeline of their romance.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mila Kunis Enjoys Lunch With Lance Bass And His Family After Refusing To Leave Her Kids An Inheritance</a></span></p><p>Many fans saw Ashton as the bad guy in his break-up with Demi, amid allegations that he cheated on her (and not just with Mila). It’s been questioned whether Demi ever reached out to Mila during the chaos to give her a heads up of what she was entering into before Ashton and Mila married in 2015. Here’s everything we know.</p><h2 id=ashton-amp-mila-started-dating-while-he-was-married-to-demi>Ashton & Mila Started Dating While He Was Married To Demi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar49178574.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the timeline of when Ashton began dating Mila, it’s been questioned whether they were having an affair or not. Their relationship may have caused him to finally pull the plug on his marriage to Demi, considering he didn’t file for divorce until after his romance with Mila started.</p><p>Interestingly, Ashton and Mila knew each other for a long time, even before his marriage to Demi. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The pair co-starred on That ‘70s Show together</a>, from 1998 to 2006; Mila started on the show when she was just a teenager. Both she and Ashton have said their relationship didn’t turn romantic until years after the show ended.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mila Kunis Refused To Sign A Certain Autograph After Her Appearance On Jimmy Kimmel, And She Was Completely Right</a></span></p><p>It’s never been confirmed whether Ashton and Mila began seeing each other when he was still committed to Demi; none of the parties have directly commented on the speculation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though they were legally married, Demi had already publicly announced their separation the year before Ashton was first romantically linked to Mila. Perhaps it was a matter of just making it official, which can become especially complicated when millions of dollars are at stake.</p><h2 id=demi-was-jealous-of-ashton-amp-mila-after-the-divorce>Demi Was Jealous Of Ashton & Mila After The Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ashton-Kutcher-And-Mila-Kunis.jpg><p>It's natural to assume that Demi would be jealous of Ashton and Mila, given that they began dating while she was still married to him. But Demi has never publicly shaded Ashton and Mila or accused her of being one of the other women. This also implies that Demi may never have seen Mila as a threat, despite her long-standing friendship with Ashton, and doesn’t blame her for the dissolution of their marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, reports from the time say it was difficult for Demi seeing Ashton move on.</p><p>“There’s no part of her that’s saying, ‘Mila Kunis is so beautiful and young, this is so humiliating,’” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source said in 2012</a>, before Demi and Ashton’s divorce was finalized. “What was humiliating was having her husband cheat on her in such a public way,” they added.</p><p>Another sign she was struggling amid their break-up was that she relapsed after decades of sobriety.</p><p>Demi’s substance abuse made her adult daughters temporarily cut off contact with until she got clean again.</p><h2 id=mila-has-called-ashton-out-for-how-he-treated-demi>Mila Has Called Ashton Out For How He Treated Demi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MilaKunisAshtonKutcherParents.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, Mila has acknowledged Ashton’s poor behavior and even criticized him for how he treated his now-ex-wife. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a joint interview with Esquire</a>, Ashton and Mila reflected on the breakdown of his marriage to Demi together. “You were an asshole,” Mila told him. “Yeah, you were an a**hole for a good two years.”</p><p>Ashton defended himself, saying that he used it as an opportunity for self-reflection and was thankful for falling in love with Mila, who he says used her brutal honesty to change him for the better.</p><p>“The thing about Mila that made our relationship accelerate was that I always admired her,” Ashton explained. “Her talents, her skills, her gifts. But I knew she didn’t need me. And she knew that I didn’t need her.”</p><p>The Two and a Half Men star said that because they “knew all of each other’s dirt,” it made their relationship work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Oona Laurence Felt 'Intimidated' Working Alongside Mila Kunis In Bad Moms</a></span></p><p>Though Demi may have once been jealous of Ashton and Mila’s relationship, she appears on amicable terms with the duo. Demi and Mila made this clear when they appeared in a commercial for AT&T in 2022 in which they mocked their joint connection to Ashton (as well as the fact they went to the same high school together, though at different times).</p><p>"I thought it would bring humor and laughs to what was already a great ad," Mila told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> of why she agreed to the project. "I reached out to her and was so delighted she jumped on board."</p><p>"Who knew being a Fairfax alum would have brought this unexpected opportunity, to come together with Mila in such a fun and playful way?" Demi piped in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that it’s been a decade since Ashton and Demi’s divorce, it’s good to see everyone getting along with no more drama.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmnJWitm65zqipnmWRo7FuucilmGajpaO2tHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./venus-and-serena-willams-dad-isn-t-getting-divorced-for-this-intimate-reason.html><span>←</span><span>Venus And Serena Willams Dad Isnt Getting Divorced For This Intimate Reason</span></a>
