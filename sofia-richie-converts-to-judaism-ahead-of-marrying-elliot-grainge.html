I want to thank cantor <strong>Nathan Lam</strong> for helping me along this journey of <a href=#>converting to Judaism,</a>” she wrote alongside a photo of herself signing a document. “It has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. Today was that day!!! ✡️✡️✡️✡️✡️.”</p><p>Prior to converting to Judaism, Richie <a href=#>grew up in a Christian household</a>. She talked about her upbringing during a January 2017 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Complex</a>. “I went to Oaks Christian [school],” she told the outlet. “That’s where I got my sense. My family wanted church to be a place where we all went together.”</p><p>The California native also described her <a href=#>faith as her “main ground”</a> and “the most interesting thing in my life.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Lionel Richie</strong></a>’s daughter <a href=#>got engaged to Grainge</a>, 29, in April 2022 after more than one year of dating. “Forever isn’t long enough @elliot,” Sofia wrote via Instagram at the time alongside a series of proposal photos.</p><p>The fashion designer was first linked to the U.K. native in January 2021. That April, a source told Us Weekly that the duo were “very happy” with how their relationship was progressing.</p><p>“They <a href=#>started out as friends</a> before they became a couple, and are now getting serious,” the insider shared at the time. “Their relationship took off and they have been getting closer and closer<a href=#> and spend practically every day together</a>.”</p><p>Sofia’s romance with Grainge came after her split from <a href=#><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>. The exes were first linked in 2017 and briefly broke up in May 2020 before reconciling two months later. They <a href=#>called it quits for good in August 2020</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Sofia’s family thinks she is way better off without him,” a source exclusively told Us of the <a href=#>Kardashians</a> personality, 39, in September 2020. “She has been separating herself from the equation and it has been the healthy thing for her and her family. … Sofia is a family girl and knowing <a href=#>her sister and dad haven’t approved of him</a> from the beginning has been a big thing for her.”</p><p>The NUDESTIX beauty director’s other previous romantic interests include <a href=#><strong>Jaden Smith</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Brooklyn Beckham</strong></a>. In October 2020, Us broke the news that Sofia had begun dating Cha Cha Matcha cofounder <a href=#><strong>Matthew Morton</strong></a>.</p><p>“They both run in the same circle and have known each other. So, it’s easy and fun for both of them. <a href=#>Sofia’s family approves of him</a>, which is super nice for her,” a source told Us at the time. It’s not clear when the exes parted ways.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasp5aerm6%2ByJyfop1dmLyvwsSrq6xlpKR6q8HDmqCspV2Wtaatw2amn2Wdlr%2BzxcinnmadnKG2sMCMoKmaoZ6csnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nate-bargatze-net-worth-how-much-is-nate-bargatze-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Nate Bargatze Net Worth How Much is Nate Bargatze Worth?</span></a>
