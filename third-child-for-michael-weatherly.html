He and his wife Bojana Jankovic are expected to have a new member in the family soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not much is known about the pregnancy though. The actor simply announced that they were expecting a child sometime in the fall this year. No doubt the two are very excited, as are their friends and family. Having a child is always good news. Congratulatory messages are already pouring in.</p><p>The couple has not bothered to find out the child’s sex. And even if they knew it, it seems that they would have opted to remain discreet. This is of course understandable. Everybody has a right to privacy.</p><p>Preparations are underway at the residence of Michael Weatherly to ensure that the arrival is very smooth. He has not yet taken a leave from work. But it is likely that he might have to take some time off prior to the delivery date. Knowing Michael, he will surely want to be with his partner and provide her all the support she needs. Bojana on her part has remained absolutely silent about all this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michael Weatherly certainly enjoys the whole experience of fatherhood. His other child with Bojana, Olivia, has just turned a year old. He also has a seventeen year old son, August, from his marriage to Amelia Heinle.</p><p>Michaela and Bojana are quite the power couple. They married in 2009. They are delighted at the prospect of raising a family. Both Michael and Bojana are very fond of kids and absolutely love the idea of being parents to two beautiful children. We have to now wait and see how everything unfolds for them. We will soon learn whether it is a boy or a girl for Michael Weatherly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZq2gmaexbq%2FHoqOdZZakv265yJyfmp2cYsSmrdOhnKukqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-truth-about-michael-pe%C3%B1a-s-net-worth-and-how-he-spends-it.html><span>←</span><span>The Truth About Michael Pea's Net Worth And How He Spends It</span></a>
