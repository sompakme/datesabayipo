The celebrated actor has even been <a href=#>dubbed “the Internet’s boyfriend,”</a> which is a title he was completely unaware of until June 2019.</p><p>Despite the world’s intrigue with Revees, the Always Be My Maybe actor has managed to keep things relatively private, <a href=#>especially as it pertains to who he dates</a>. He was last <a href=#>reported to be dating actress <strong>China Chow</strong></a> in 2008, but Reeves more recently sparked interest in his romantic life once again when <a href=#>he stepped out holding hands with <strong>Alexandra Grant</strong></a> at the LACMA Art + Film Gala in November 2019.</p><p>The Constantine actor has been friends with Grant for years after they first met in 2009 at a dinner party. “It wasn’t a secret,” an insider told Us Weekly of the pair’s romance in November 2019. “They have been dating since at least [the] summer of 2017.”</p><p>Reeves has never been married, but he opened up about the idea of settling down during an interview with Parade in 2006.</p><p>“I’m trying not to be alone so much,” he told the magazine. “And man, it’s a struggle. I want to get married. I want to have kids. That’s at the top of the mountain. I’ve got to climb the mountain first. I’ll do it. Just give me some time.”</p><p>Reeves also mentioned his “vagabond” lifestyle, where he explained to the publication how “there is a bit of the gypsy” in him. He argued that “living that way seemed to make sense” for him.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I couldn’t settle down. I liked going to new places — renting apartments, staying in hotels. Then I turned 40,” he continued. “That birthday is hard, perhaps because, you know, you’re grown-up. So now it’s a makeover for me. I have bought my first house. I wanted a home.”</p><p>Scroll down to take a closer look at who Reeves has been linked to over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKatza5kq52Vq7K0ecOaq6Kml2K1qr%2FTqKmyZZFisK270p6pZqSfpLhw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-grace-kinnear-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Grace Kinnear Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
