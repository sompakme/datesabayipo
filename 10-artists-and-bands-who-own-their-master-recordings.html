The pop star recently railed against Braun on Tumblr after he <a href=#>bought Big Machine Label Group</a>, including her back catalog of master recordings.</p><p>“For years I asked, pleaded for a chance to own my work. Instead I was given an opportunity to sign back up to Big Machine Records and ‘earn’ one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in,” Swift wrote in the post. “I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, [Big Machine founder] <strong>Scott Borchetta</strong> would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future. I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past. Music I wrote on my bedroom floor and videos I dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned playing in bars, then clubs, then arenas, then stadiums.”</p><p>Swift explained in the post that her “worst case scenario” was that her back catalog would be sold to Braun, claiming that Braun <a href=#>had encouraged his famous clients to bully her over the years</a>. “When I left my masters in Scott’s hands, I made peace with the fact that eventually he would sell them,” she continued. “Never in my worst nightmares did I imagine the buyer would be Scooter. Any time Scott Borchetta has heard the words ‘Scooter Braun’ escape my lips, it was when I was either crying or trying not to. He knew what he was doing; they both did. Controlling a woman who didn’t want to be associated with them. In perpetuity. That means forever.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The “You Need to Calm Down” singer does, however, have ownership of the masters she has recorded since signing with Republic Records in 2018.
