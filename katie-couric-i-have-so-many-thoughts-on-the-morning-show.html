In November 2017, he was fired from <a href=#>NBC News after he was accused of sexual misconduct</a>. Lauer, <a href=#>who was later accused of rape by former employee <strong>Brooke Nevils</strong></a>, denied all the allegations against him.</p><p>“[Mitch is] not Matt Lauer,” Morning Show showrunner <a href=#><strong>Kerry Ehrin</strong> told The Hollywood Reporter </a>in November 2019. “It wasn’t designed to be about him; I didn’t study him. It was about a guy who works in morning news who gets fired for sexual misconduct. That did happen to Matt Lauer. It also happened to <a href=#><strong>Charlie Rose and</strong> someone on Fox</a> — it isn’t exclusively Matt Lauer.”</p><p>Couric told Pellegrino that she’s writing about “all about all this stuff” in her upcoming book.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The journalist also noted that she doesn’t tune into Today much anymore.</p><p>“Not really. Not too much. I look at newsletters, I really get most of my news on my telephone,” she explained. “I think I just changed the way I consume my news and information.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKarJmaeqS71KugnGWZYrWiwsRmqqhlnZa7unnToaaun5ipwG67zWaroZ1doryzusinnmarmKTEcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josh-duhamel-s-hot-body-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>Josh Duhamel's Hot Body | Us Weekly</span></a>
