Jose Segura, initially struggled to believe this unexplained occurrence was real, but after further examination he’s now convinced it’s truly happening.</p><p>Judy Ronquillo, the business manager for the church, told the publication of the Spanish-speaking priest, “It’s something extraordinary for him. He has no words for it.”</p><p>The church and a team of investigators has found no liquid coming from the ceiling that could be responsible for the tears, which have been tested and appear to be a clear olive oil that has been treated with some kind of scent, possibly similar to chrism. Furthermore, officials even contacted the statute’s manufacturer, who ensured them nothing could be leaking from within the hollow, cast bronze figure.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Still, WaPo notes that photos and a video released by the church shows the statue with what appears to be liquid inside the eyes and around the cheeks, mouth and chin.
