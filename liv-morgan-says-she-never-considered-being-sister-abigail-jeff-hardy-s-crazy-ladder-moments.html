Liv said, “I think it’s very flattering fanfiction. I, I was never, you know, respectfully, hoping to be Sister Abigail. I was never pushing to be Sister Abigail. I went away for a while and I’m finding myself and I’m exploring myself and I have all these thoughts and emotions and I’m trying to let people know without literally saying it. And they just, kind of , wanted me to return so bad. I think they felt that was it. That was what I was going to be doing. That’s a very flattering, you know, fanfic. But all it is is fanfic.”</p><p>Fans now seem to think that Alexa Bliss is in line to become Sister Abigail, and only time will tell if that is the direction that creative goes.</p><h2>Jeff Hardy’s Craziest Ladder Moments</h2><p><a href=#>Jeff Hardy</a> will once again be featured in a ladder match for WWE and to commemorate the match, a new episode of WWE Top 10 has been published that features Hardy’s craziest ladder match moments.</p><p>Take a look at the complete list below and let us know in the comments below what your favorite Jeff Hardy ladder moment is of all-time.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFpanBqYGK5qsKMpqarn5GjerSt2KxkrKCVYrumwsSrZJynnqi2pbHRnptmmpWeu6h50qKqrZ2iYq6jtcaaoKVlmpqzp3nHmqmdsaNir6a%2F02ajmpyUmr9uuc6mnKesow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./keanu-reeves-dating-history-a-closer-look.html><span>←</span><span>Keanu Reeves' Dating History: A Closer Look</span></a>
